# Docs slimming implementation plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Shrink `docs/` from 71,361 lines across 183 files to a living set a person can hold, by retiring closed work into archives the guard still polices — and by closing the enforcement hole that let three task IDs collide unnoticed.

**Architecture:** Nothing is deleted and no ID is renamed. Closed entries move into sibling files; `check_docs.py` stops naming ledger files one by one and starts globbing a directory, so an archive stays inside the duplicate-ID and dependency graph. The enforcement fix lands *before* the first move, because moving 295 entries while the guard is blind to 30 of them is how the next collision gets written.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12 (`check_docs.py`, `unittest`), Markdown, GitHub Actions.

**Spec:** This plan is its own spec — every number in it was measured on `3fdd3d65` and the measurement command is quoted beside the number. No requirement below comes from a document that does not exist.

## The measurement this plan argues from

Taken on `docs/wbs.md` at `3fdd3d65`, worktree clean:

| Fact | Value | How it was measured |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/wbs.md` | 19,856 lines · 1.45 MB · 302 `### M/T` entries | `wc -l`, `grep -c '^### [TM][0-9]'` |
| Entries whose Status starts `done` | **295 · 19,312 lines · 97%** | status parse per entry (see below) |
| Entries not `done` | 7 · 503 lines | same |
| Genuinely in progress | **1** — `M99.29` | the other six are `descoped` ×3, `integrated`, `superseded`, and one stale |
| Task headings the guard can see | **282 of 312** | `_TASK_HEAD_RE` vs `^#{2,3} [TM][0-9]` |
| Duplicate task IDs present | **3** — `M99.53`, `M99.54`, `M99.55` | six distinct tasks sharing three numbers |
| Distinct BR/AD/UC IDs · citations | 315 · **14,789** | `grep -rhoE '\b(BR\|AD\|UC)-[0-9]+' docs .claude CLAUDE.md lib test` |

The status census is reproducible with:

```bash
python -X utf8 - <<'PY'
import io, re, collections
lines = io.open('docs/wbs.md', encoding='utf-8').read().split('\n')
hdrs = [(i, l) for i, l in enumerate(lines) if re.match(r'^### [TM][0-9]', l)]
done = collections.defaultdict(lambda: [0, 0]); openv = collections.defaultdict(lambda: [0, 0])
for k, (i, l) in enumerate(hdrs):
    end = hdrs[k+1][0] if k+1 < len(hdrs) else len(lines)
    body = '\n'.join(lines[i:end])
    ms = re.match(r'([TM][0-9]+)', l.split()[1]).group(1)
    m = re.search(r'^- \*\*Status:\*\*\s*\**(\S+)', body, re.M)
    st = (m.group(1) if m else 'none').strip().lower().strip('*')
    t = done if st.startswith('done') else openv
    t[ms][0] += 1; t[ms][1] += end - i
for ms in sorted(set(done) | set(openv), key=lambda s: (len(s), s)):
    print(ms, 'done', done.get(ms, [0,0]), 'open', openv.get(ms, [0,0]))
PY
```

Per-milestone, which is what sizes the archive files:

| Milestone | done entries | done lines | open entries | open lines |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T0 · T1 | 8 | 236 | 0 | 0 |
| M2 | 9 | 474 | 0 | 0 |
| M3 | 12 | 669 | 0 | 0 |
| M4 | 83 | 4,854 | 3 | 101 |
| M5 | 28 | 1,756 | 0 | 0 |
| M99 | 96 | 7,050 | 2 | 268 |
| M100 | 59 | 4,273 | 2 | 134 |
| **Total** | **295** | **19,312** | **7** | **503** |

## Global Constraints

Every task's requirements implicitly include this section. Values are copied
verbatim from the code they describe.

- **No ID is renamed except the three that collide.** 14,789 citations across
  `docs/`, `lib/`, `test/`, `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/skills/` resolve by ID, not
  by file path, so moving a definition between files breaks nothing. Renaming
  one breaks everything that cites it.
- **Nothing is deleted.** Content moves; git history is not the archive.
- **`check_docs.py` must stay green at every commit**, run as CI runs it:
  `python .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet`
- **The tooling tests must stay green**, run as CI runs them:
  `python -m unittest discover -s .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests -p 'test_*.py'`
- **Every new guard rule is fault-injected before it is trusted.** A rule that
  has never been seen to fail is a rule that has never been seen. This is the
  repo's own standard: `code-verification-guard-v2` runs its probes *before* its
  verdict for exactly this reason (`ci.yml`, "guard self-tests").
- **`_docs_md()` globs three places and only three:** `docs/*.md`,
  `docs/it-scenarios/*.md`, `docs/design-system/*.md`. A file placed there
  inherits the 7-field header contract (`Status`, `Purpose`, `Scope`,
  `Source of truth for`, `Depends on`, `Updated by task`, `Last updated`) and
  the "no two documents claim the same source of truth" rule. A file placed
  anywhere else under `docs/` inherits neither. **Archive directories are
  therefore placed outside that glob on purpose.**
- **Frozen documents.** `docs/product.md`, `docs/business-rules.md`,
  `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/use-cases.md` and `docs/data-model.md` carry
  Status `frozen for MVP`. CLAUDE.md forbids a task from editing one unless the
  task names it. Phase 4 names them; Phases 0–3 must not touch them.
- **Vietnamese is this repo's language for `docs/wbs.md`.** New WBS prose is
  written in Vietnamese; guard code, comments and commit messages stay English.

## File Structure

**Created**

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `docs/wbs-archive/README.md` | Index: one line per archive file, what milestone it holds, how many entries |
| `docs/wbs-archive/t0-t1-m2-m3.md` | 29 closed entries, 1,379 lines — the harness and foundation milestones |
| `docs/wbs-archive/m4.md` | 83 closed entries, 4,854 lines |
| `docs/wbs-archive/m5.md` | 28 closed entries, 1,756 lines |
| `docs/wbs-archive/m99.md` | 96 closed entries, 7,050 lines |
| `docs/wbs-archive/m100.md` | 59 closed entries, 4,273 lines |
| `docs/reviews/archive/README.md` | Index: one line per retired audit — its ID, subject, and the task that consumed it |

**Modified**

| Path | Change |
|---|---|
| `.claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py` | Widen the task-ID regex; add a wrong-heading-level rule; make the ledger set a glob |
| `.claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests/test_check_docs.py` | New file — fault injection for all three rules |
| `docs/wbs.md` | Status correction; three renumbered entries; 295 entries move out; header and Progress summary rewritten |
| `docs/README.md` | `## What exists` gains the two archive directories |

Files that change together live together: the guard rule and its fault
injection are one task, never two.

## Phase 0 — The ledger tells the truth about today

One task. It is first because every later phase moves this file, and moving a
file that is already lying just relocates the lie.

### Task 1: Correct M100.61's status

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/wbs.md` — the `### M100.61` entry
- Test: `python .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing
- Produces: nothing later tasks depend on. This is a content fix.

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm the drift is real, not remembered**

```bash
git log --oneline -1 --grep='M100.61'
grep -n -A2 '^### M100.61' docs/wbs.md | head -5
```

Expected: the log shows `3fdd3d65 feat(deck,study): the two loud heroes join
the five quiet ones (M100.61) (#508)` while the entry still reads
`**Status:** in review (2026-09-08) — **bản thử, chưa merge theo yêu cầu chủ
dự án**`. If the log shows no such commit, stop — this task's premise is gone
and the plan needs re-measuring.

- [ ] **Step 2: Rewrite the Status line and the open acceptance criterion**

Replace the Status line with:

```markdown
- **Status:** done (2026-09-08) — merged as `3fdd3d65` (#508). Shipped as a
  trial for aesthetic review first; the owner approved it on the before/after
  gallery and it was merged in the same session.
```

And the last acceptance criterion, currently unchecked, becomes:

```markdown
  - [x] Chủ dự án review gallery trước–sau rồi mới quyết merge hay bỏ.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify the guard still passes**

Run: `python .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet`
Expected: exit 0. The M-task template rule requires a non-empty acceptance
block; a `- [x]` box satisfies `_AC_BOX_RE` exactly as `- [ ]` did.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/wbs.md
git commit -m "docs(wbs): M100.61 says merged, because it is

The entry still read 'bản thử, chưa merge' after 3fdd3d65 landed it. A ledger
that lags the code is worse than no ledger: the next session trusts it.

## Phase 1 — Close the enforcement hole

Two tasks, in this order. The guard is widened first so it goes **red** on the
three real collisions; then the collisions are fixed and it goes green. Doing
it the other way round proves nothing.

### Task 2: The guard sees every task heading, and refuses one written at the wrong level

**Files:**
- Modify: `.claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py:200-201` and `_check_wbs_tasks`
- Create: `.claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests/test_check_docs.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing
- Produces: `_TASK_HEAD_RE` matching a two-letter suffix; a new
  `_check_task_heading_level()` called from `_check_wbs_tasks()`. Task 3
  depends on this rule being live; Task 4 replaces the file list it iterates.

**Why both changes are one task:** they answer the same question — "which
headings are tasks?" — and splitting them would leave a commit where the guard
counts 303 headings but still cannot see three of them.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Create `.claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests/test_check_docs.py`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import importlib.util
import sys
import unittest
from pathlib import Path

SCRIPTS = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]


def _load(name: str):
    spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(name, SCRIPTS / f"{name}.py")
    assert spec and spec.loader
    module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
    sys.modules[name] = module
    spec.loader.exec_module(module)
    return module


check_docs = _load("check_docs")


class TaskHeadingRegexTest(unittest.TestCase):
    """The id shapes this ledger actually uses, not the ones it started with."""

    def test_a_one_letter_suffix_is_a_task(self) -> None:
        m = check_docs._TASK_HEAD_RE.match("### M4.10a · something")
        self.assertIsNotNone(m)
        self.assertEqual(m.group(1), "M4.10a")

    def test_a_two_letter_suffix_is_a_task(self) -> None:
        # 21 entries in docs/wbs.md are shaped this way (M4.10aa..M4.10at) and
        # the original `[a-z]?` could not see one of them, so none of them was
        # in the duplicate check or the dependency graph.
        m = check_docs._TASK_HEAD_RE.match("### M4.10aa · something")
        self.assertIsNotNone(m)
        self.assertEqual(m.group(1), "M4.10aa")

    def test_a_three_letter_suffix_is_not(self) -> None:
        # The bound is deliberate: `[a-z]*` would swallow a prose heading that
        # merely starts with an M and a number.
        self.assertIsNone(check_docs._TASK_HEAD_RE.match("### M4.10abc · x"))

    def test_the_token_form_agrees_with_the_heading_form(self) -> None:
        # A dependency names a bare token; if the two regexes disagree, a
        # legal id becomes an unresolvable dependency.
        self.assertIsNotNone(check_docs._TASK_TOKEN_RE.match("M4.10aa"))


class HeadingLevelTest(unittest.TestCase):
    """A dotted task id at `##` is a task hiding from the duplicate check."""

    def test_a_dotted_id_at_section_level_is_a_finding(self) -> None:
        bad = check_docs._wrong_level_task_headings(
            ("## M99.55 — Deck review", "### M99.55 · MxDialogTone")
        )
        self.assertEqual(bad, ["## M99.55 — Deck review"])

    def test_a_milestone_header_at_section_level_is_fine(self) -> None:
        # `## M4 · Router and Drift foundation` is a section, not a task: no
        # dot, no 9-field template, and it has been legal since M0.
        self.assertEqual(
            check_docs._wrong_level_task_headings(
                ("## M4 · Router and Drift foundation", "## M99 · Adhoc")
            ),
            [],
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests -p 'test_check_docs.py'
```
Expected: FAIL — `test_a_two_letter_suffix_is_a_task` fails with
`AssertionError: unexpectedly None`, and both `HeadingLevelTest` cases fail with
`AttributeError: module 'check_docs' has no attribute '_wrong_level_task_headings'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Widen the two regexes**

In `check_docs.py`, replace lines 200-201:

```python
_TASK_HEAD_RE = re.compile(r"^### ([TM][0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?[a-z]?) ")
_TASK_TOKEN_RE = re.compile(r"^[TM][0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?[a-z]?$")
```

with:

```python
# **Two letters, because the ledger ran out of one.** `M4.10a`…`M4.10z` filled
# up during the deck redesign and the next twenty-one entries became
# `M4.10aa`…`M4.10at` — legal ids that this regex could not match, so twenty-one
# tasks sat outside the duplicate check and outside the dependency graph while
# the check reported success over the rest. The bound stays finite: `[a-z]*`
# would match a prose heading that happens to open with an M and a number.
_TASK_HEAD_RE = re.compile(r"^### ([TM][0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?[a-z]{0,2}) ")
_TASK_TOKEN_RE = re.compile(r"^[TM][0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?[a-z]{0,2}$")
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the heading-level rule**

Immediately after `_TASK_TOKEN_RE`, add:

```python
# A task id carries a dot (`M99.55`); a milestone section does not (`M99`).
# That is the whole difference, and it is enough to tell a task written at the
# wrong level from a section header that has been legal since M0.
_WRONG_LEVEL_RE = re.compile(r"^## [TM][0-9]+\.[0-9]+[a-z]{0,2} ")


def _wrong_level_task_headings(lines: tuple[str, ...] | list[str]) -> list[str]:
    """Task headings written at `##`, where the task rules cannot reach them.

    **This is not a style rule.** `_TASK_HEAD_RE` anchors on `### `, so a task
    written one level up is invisible to the duplicate-id check, to the
    dependency graph, and to the 9-field template check — all three at once.
    Three entries in `docs/wbs.md` were written that way and each collided with
    a real `###` task: `M99.53`, `M99.54` and `M99.55` named six different
    pieces of work between them, and the guard printed "no duplicate WBS task
    IDs" over the top of it.
    """
    return [line.rstrip() for line in lines if _WRONG_LEVEL_RE.match(line)]
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Call it from `_check_wbs_tasks`**

At the top of `_check_wbs_tasks()`, immediately after `task_ids = _wbs_task_ids()`, insert:

```python
    before_level = _problems
    for path in (WBS_FILE, STUDY_WBS_FILE):
        for heading in _wrong_level_task_headings(_lines(path)):
            _fail(
                "task heading written at section level",
                f"{path}: {heading[:72]}\n      "
                "a dotted task id belongs at '### '; at '##' it is invisible "
                "to the duplicate check, the dependency graph and the template "
                "check",
            )
    if _problems == before_level:
        _ok("no task heading is written at section level")
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests -p 'test_check_docs.py'
```
Expected: PASS, 6 tests.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the guard and expect it to go RED — this is the point**

Run: `python .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet`
Expected: **FAIL**, with three findings — one per heading written at `##`:

```
task heading written at section level
  docs/wbs.md: ## M99.55 — Deck review: đo những khung gallery chưa từng chụp
task heading written at section level
  docs/wbs.md: ## M99.54 — `MxButtonPair` hỏi hai nút thay vì đoán
task heading written at section level
  docs/wbs.md: ## M99.53 — Pixel comparison trở thành cổng của PR
```

The duplicate rule stays quiet here on purpose: `_TASK_HEAD_RE` anchors on
`### `, so the `##` copies are still outside it. The new rule is the only thing
that can see them, which is why it had to exist before Task 3 could act. If the
guard passes here, the rule is not wired in — go back to Step 5.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit the guard alone, red**

The guard is committed red on purpose: the commit that widens a rule and the
commit that cleans up after it are two different reviews, and squashing them
hides which one found what.

```bash
git add .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py \
        .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests/test_check_docs.py
git commit -m "fix(docs-guard): see the 30 task headings it was missing

_TASK_HEAD_RE allowed one optional letter after the number, so the 21
M4.10aa..M4.10at entries never entered the duplicate check or the dependency
graph. A separate hole: a dotted task id written at '##' is invisible to all
three task rules at once, and three entries are written that way.

The guard fails on this commit. That is the finding, not a regression.

### Task 3: The three collisions get their own numbers

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/wbs.md:7920`, `:8034`, `:8075`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `_wrong_level_task_headings` from Task 2 — it is what proves this task worked.
- Produces: task IDs `M100.62`, `M100.63`, `M100.64`. No later task depends on them.

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm which of each pair is which**

```bash
grep -nE "^#{2,3} M99\.5[345]" docs/wbs.md
```

Expected exactly six lines: three at `##` (7920, 8034, 8075) and three at `###`
(12431, 12516, 12560). The `###` copies keep their numbers — they are already
in the dependency graph and may be cited. The `##` copies are renumbered.

- [ ] **Step 2: Renumber and re-level the three headings**

`docs/wbs.md:7920`:
```markdown
### M100.62 · Deck review: đo những khung gallery chưa từng chụp, rồi sửa cái đo được
```

`docs/wbs.md:8034`:
```markdown
### M100.63 · `MxButtonPair` hỏi hai nút thay vì đoán
```

`docs/wbs.md:8075`:
```markdown
### M100.64 · Pixel comparison trở thành cổng của PR
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Record the renumber inside each entry**

Immediately under each new heading, add a first bullet. For `M100.62`:

```markdown
- **Đổi số 2026-09-08.** Entry này từng mang số `M99.55` và được viết ở cấp
  `##`, nên guard không nhìn thấy nó: `M99.55` khi đó cũng là số của một task
  khác (`MxDialogTone`, dòng 12560). Sáu task dùng chung ba số và
  `check_docs.py` vẫn in "no duplicate WBS task IDs" vì nó chỉ thấy một nửa.
  Bản `###` giữ số cũ vì đã nằm trong đồ thị dependency; bản này nhận số mới.
```

For `M100.63`, the same paragraph with `M99.54` and *"Checkbox đã tick bị co
lại 4dp, dòng 12516"*. For `M100.64`, `M99.53` and *"`MxButtonPair`, dòng
12431"*.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify each renumbered entry still meets the 9-field template**

Run: `python .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet`
Expected: **FAIL** if any of the three lacks a field — they were written at
`##` and so were never template-checked. `_M_REQUIRED` is: `Status`, `Goal`,
`Scope`, `Editable documents`, `Output`, `Acceptance criteria`, `Dependencies`,
`Tests required`, `Checklist phases`, plus at least one `- [ ]` or `- [x]` box.
Add whatever is missing from what the entry already says; do not invent
acceptance criteria that were never met — if the work is closed, write the
criteria it actually satisfied and tick them.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the guard to verify it now passes**

Run: `python .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet`
Expected: exit 0, and the summary line reads
`no duplicate WBS task IDs (320 tasks)`.

**The arithmetic, because a bare number proves nothing.** The guard counts
*distinct ids across both ledgers*, not headings in one file. It read **297**
before Task 2; Task 2's widened suffix bound added the 20 `M4.10aa`…`M4.10at`
entries it could not match, taking it to **317**; your three promoted headings
are three ids it has never seen, so it lands on **320**. If you get 317, the
headings are still at `##`. If you get 318 or 319, one or two of them kept a
number that already exists — which is the collision this task exists to end.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/wbs.md
git commit -m "docs(wbs): six tasks stop sharing three numbers

M99.53, M99.54 and M99.55 each named two unrelated pieces of work. The copy
written at '##' takes M100.62/63/64 and moves to '###'; the copy at '###'
keeps its number because it is already in the dependency graph. Each entry
records the number it used to carry.

The template check reaches all three for the first time.

## Phase 2 — The ledger keeps the living work; the archive keeps the rest

Three tasks. **Task 4 must land before any entry moves.**

### Task 4: The ledger set becomes a glob

**Files:**
- Modify: `.claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py` — `WBS_FILE`/`STUDY_WBS_FILE` block and `_check_wbs_tasks`
- Modify: `.claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests/test_check_docs.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `_wrong_level_task_headings` (Task 2).
- Produces: `_wbs_ledgers() -> list[str]`. Tasks 5 and 6 rely on archive files
  being inside the duplicate-ID and dependency scan; nothing else calls it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `test_check_docs.py`:

```python
class LedgerSetTest(unittest.TestCase):
    """Every file that can define a task id is in the duplicate scan."""

    def test_the_live_ledgers_are_in_the_set(self) -> None:
        ledgers = check_docs._wbs_ledgers()
        self.assertIn("docs/wbs.md", ledgers)
        self.assertIn("docs/wbs-study.md", ledgers)

    def test_an_archive_file_joins_without_a_code_change(self) -> None:
        # A glob rather than a list, because the alternative is what already
        # happened: `wbs-study.md` was added by name and became the only
        # companion the guard would ever know about.
        import tempfile, pathlib
        with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:
            root = pathlib.Path(tmp)
            (root / "docs" / "wbs-archive").mkdir(parents=True)
            (root / "docs" / "wbs.md").write_text("# x", encoding="utf-8")
            (root / "docs" / "wbs-archive" / "m4.md").write_text(
                "### M4.1 · x", encoding="utf-8"
            )
            original = check_docs._REPO
            try:
                check_docs._REPO = root
                self.assertIn("docs/wbs-archive/m4.md", check_docs._wbs_ledgers())
            finally:
                check_docs._REPO = original
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to verify it fails**

Run:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests -p 'test_check_docs.py'
```
Expected: FAIL — `AttributeError: module 'check_docs' has no attribute '_wbs_ledgers'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the glob**

In `check_docs.py`, after line 101 (`STUDY_WBS_FILE = "docs/wbs-study.md"`), add:

```python
WBS_ARCHIVE_DIR = "docs/wbs-archive"


def _wbs_ledgers() -> list[str]:
    """Every file that can define a WBS task id.

    **The duplicate rule and the dependency graph are only true over the whole
    set.** An id retired into the archive is still spent — reusing it names two
    pieces of work — and a live task may legitimately depend on one that closed.
    Both facts stop being checkable the moment a ledger file is outside this
    list.

    A glob, not another named constant. `STUDY_WBS_FILE` was added by name when
    the Study feature took its own ledger, and it has been the only companion
    the guard knows about ever since; the next archive file must not need a
    code change to be seen.

    The archive lives outside `_docs_md()`'s three globs on purpose: a retired
    entry is not a contract document and should not have to carry the 7-field
    header or claim a source of truth.
    """
    paths = [WBS_FILE, STUDY_WBS_FILE]
    archive = _REPO / WBS_ARCHIVE_DIR
    if archive.is_dir():
        paths.extend(
            sorted(p.relative_to(_REPO).as_posix() for p in archive.glob("*.md"))
        )
    return [p for p in paths if (_REPO / p).is_file()]
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Use it in the three places that iterate ledgers**

In `_check_wbs_tasks()`, replace `for path in (WBS_FILE, STUDY_WBS_FILE):` in
the duplicate scan with `for path in _wbs_ledgers():`.

Replace the `task_set` construction:

```python
    task_set = set(task_ids) | {
        m.group(1)
        for line in _lines(STUDY_WBS_FILE)
        if (m := _TASK_HEAD_RE.match(line))
    }
```

with:

```python
    task_set = {
        m.group(1)
        for path in _wbs_ledgers()
        for line in _lines(path)
        if (m := _TASK_HEAD_RE.match(line))
    }
```

And in the heading-level loop added in Task 2, replace
`for path in (WBS_FILE, STUDY_WBS_FILE):` with `for path in _wbs_ledgers():`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests -p 'test_*.py'
```
Expected: PASS, all suites.

- [ ] **Step 6: Fault-inject against the real tree**

```bash
mkdir -p docs/wbs-archive
printf '### M99.29 · duplicate probe\n' > docs/wbs-archive/_probe.md
python .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet; echo "exit=$?"
rm docs/wbs-archive/_probe.md
```

Expected: exit **non-zero**, naming `M99.29 is defined 2 times` and printing
both locations. If it exits 0, the glob is not wired into the duplicate scan
and Phase 2 is unsafe — stop and fix Step 4.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py \
        .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests/test_check_docs.py
git commit -m "feat(docs-guard): the ledger set is a glob, not two names

An id retired into an archive is still spent, and a live task may depend on
one that closed — so the duplicate rule and the dependency graph have to see
the archive. A glob rather than a third named constant: wbs-study.md was added
by name and became the only companion this guard would ever know about.

Fault-injected: an id duplicated into docs/wbs-archive/ fails the check.

### Task 5: Move the closed milestones out, one commit each

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/wbs-archive/t0-t1-m2-m3.md`, `m4.md`, `m5.md`, `m99.md`, `m100.md`
- Modify: `docs/wbs.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `_wbs_ledgers()` (Task 4).
- Produces: five archive files. Task 6 writes the index over them.

**Five commits, not one.** Each is independently reviewable and revertable, and
a bad move in M99 should not force M4 to be re-reviewed.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the archive file header (no 7-field contract needed)**

Each archive file opens with exactly this, with the milestone substituted:

```markdown
# WBS archive — M4

Closed entries moved out of `docs/wbs.md` on 2026-09-08 (M100.65). **Nothing
was edited on the way**: each entry is byte-identical to the one that left the
ledger, and the ids are still in `check_docs.py`'s duplicate scan and
dependency graph through `_wbs_ledgers()`.

This file is not a contract document and carries no 7-field header — it sits
outside `_docs_md()`'s globs deliberately. The living ledger is `../wbs.md`.

---
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Move T0/T1/M2/M3 — the smallest milestone first**

Cut every `### T0`, `### T1`, `### M2.x` and `### M3.x` entry whose Status
starts `done` from `docs/wbs.md` (29 entries, 1,379 lines) and paste them, in
document order, under the header into `docs/wbs-archive/t0-t1-m2-m3.md`.

Leave the `## M2 · Project foundation` and `## M3 · Architecture and design
foundation` section headings in `docs/wbs.md`, each now holding a single line:

```markdown
Mọi task của milestone này đã đóng — xem `wbs-archive/t0-t1-m2-m3.md`.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify nothing was lost or altered**

```bash
python -X utf8 - <<'PY'
import subprocess, re
old = subprocess.run(['git', 'show', 'HEAD:docs/wbs.md'],
                     capture_output=True, text=True, encoding='utf-8').stdout
new = open('docs/wbs.md', encoding='utf-8').read()
arch = open('docs/wbs-archive/t0-t1-m2-m3.md', encoding='utf-8').read()
ids = lambda s: re.findall(r'^### ([TM][0-9][^\s]*) ', s, re.M)
before, after = set(ids(old)), set(ids(new)) | set(ids(arch))
print('lost:', sorted(before - after))
print('gained:', sorted(after - before))
PY
```

Expected: both lists empty. A non-empty `lost` means an entry was dropped in
the cut — restore it before continuing.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the guard**

Run: `python .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet`
Expected: exit 0, still `no duplicate WBS task IDs (312 tasks)` — the count
must not move, because nothing was deleted.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/wbs.md docs/wbs-archive/t0-t1-m2-m3.md
git commit -m "docs(wbs): T0, T1, M2 and M3 retire to the archive (M100.65)

29 closed entries, 1,379 lines, byte-identical. Their ids stay in the
duplicate scan and the dependency graph through _wbs_ledgers().

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Repeat Steps 2–5 for M4**

83 entries, 4,854 lines → `docs/wbs-archive/m4.md`. **Three M4 entries stay in
`docs/wbs.md`:** `M4.5`, `M4.6` and `M4.7` are `descoped`, not `done`, and a
descope is a live decision a reader needs in the ledger. Commit message body:
`83 closed entries, 4,854 lines. M4.5/4.6/4.7 stay: descoped is a live
decision, not closed work.`

- [ ] **Step 7: Repeat Steps 2–5 for M5**

28 entries, 1,756 lines → `docs/wbs-archive/m5.md`. Note in the commit that
`docs/wbs-study.md` is untouched and remains a live ledger.

- [ ] **Step 8: Repeat Steps 2–5 for M99**

96 entries, 7,050 lines → `docs/wbs-archive/m99.md`. **Two M99 entries stay:**
`M99.29` (`in-progress` — the one genuinely live task in the file) and `M99.32`
(`integrated`, which is not `done`).

- [ ] **Step 9: Repeat Steps 2–5 for M100**

59 entries, 4,273 lines → `docs/wbs-archive/m100.md`. **Two M100 entries stay:**
`M100.27` (`superseded`) and `M100.61` (now `done` after Task 1 — move it, it
is closed). Re-count before cutting: Task 1 changed M100.61's status, so the
`done` count for M100 is 60, not 59, and one fewer entry stays behind.

- [ ] **Step 10: Rewrite the ledger's header and Progress summary**

`docs/wbs.md` is now roughly 600 lines. Update its 7-field header:

```markdown
| **Purpose** | Sổ tiến độ — nguồn duy nhất cho việc gì **đang** làm, bị chặn, hoặc đã descope. Việc đã đóng nằm ở `wbs-archive/` |
| **Scope** | Task đang mở · blocker · technical debt · quyết định descope/superseded. Ngoài phạm vi: entry đã `done` — chúng ở `wbs-archive/`, vẫn trong đồ thị dependency qua `_wbs_ledgers()` |
| **Updated by task** | M100.65 |
| **Last updated** | 2026-09-08 |
```

And replace the Progress summary with the real counts:

```markdown
## Progress summary

| | Sổ sống | Archive | Tổng |
|---|---|---|---|
| Entry | 7 | 295 | 302 |
| Dòng | ~600 | 19,312 | ~19,900 |

**Đang chạy: một task** — `M99.29`. Sáu entry còn lại ở sổ sống mang trạng thái
cuối (`descoped` ×3, `integrated`, `superseded`) và ở lại vì chúng là quyết
định người đọc cần thấy, không phải việc đã xong.
```

- [ ] **Step 11: Full verification, then commit**

```bash
python .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet && echo "docs OK"
python -m unittest discover -s .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests -p 'test_*.py'
wc -l docs/wbs.md docs/wbs-archive/*.md
git add docs/wbs.md
git commit -m "docs(wbs): the ledger states what it now holds (M100.65)

7 open entries, ~600 lines, one of them actually in progress. The header and
the Progress summary said neither.

```

### Task 6: The archive gets an index and the docs README learns it exists

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/wbs-archive/README.md`
- Modify: `docs/README.md` — the `## What exists` section

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the five archive files from Task 5.
- Produces: nothing later tasks depend on.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the index**

`docs/wbs-archive/README.md`:

```markdown
# WBS archive

Closed WBS entries, moved out of `../wbs.md` on 2026-09-08 (M100.65) so the
living ledger holds only living work. **Nothing here was edited on the way
out** — each entry is byte-identical to the one that left.

These files are still policed. `check_docs.py`'s `_wbs_ledgers()` globs this
directory, so a retired id cannot be reused and a live task may depend on one
that closed. They are deliberately outside `_docs_md()`, so they carry no
7-field header and claim no source of truth: a retired entry is a record, not
a contract.

| File | Milestone | Entries | Lines |
|---|---|---|---|
| `t0-t1-m2-m3.md` | harness, project foundation, architecture foundation | 29 | 1,379 |
| `m4.md` | router and Drift foundation, deck and card slices | 83 | 4,854 |
| `m5.md` | study vertical slice — UC-05 | 28 | 1,756 |
| `m99.md` | adhoc feature and hardening work | 96 | 7,050 |
| `m100.md` | design-system reconciliation and screen consistency | 60 | 4,273 |

**Where to look for what.** A task id tells you the file: `M4.10ap` is in
`m4.md`, `M99.62` in `m99.md`. To find every mention of a task across both the
ledger and the archive:

```bash
grep -rn "M99\.62" docs/wbs.md docs/wbs-archive/
```
```

Fill the Entries and Lines columns from the actual result of Task 5:

```bash
for f in docs/wbs-archive/*.md; do
  printf "%-24s %3d entries %6d lines\n" "$(basename "$f")" \
    "$(grep -c '^### [TM][0-9]' "$f")" "$(wc -l < "$f")"
done
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add both archives to the docs index**

In `docs/README.md`, inside `## What exists`, add:

```markdown
- `wbs-archive/` — entry WBS đã đóng, tách khỏi `wbs.md` ở M100.65. Vẫn nằm
  trong kiểm trùng ID và đồ thị dependency; xem `wbs-archive/README.md`.
```

**Do not add it to `## Not written yet`** — `_check_not_written_yet()` fails
for any `` `name.md` `` listed there whose file exists.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify**

Run: `python .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet`
Expected: exit 0.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/wbs-archive/README.md docs/README.md
git commit -m "docs(wbs): the archive says what is in it and why it is still guarded

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

---

## Phase 3 — Closed audits leave the working set

One task. `docs/reviews/` is 26 files and 24,221 lines — 34% of all doc lines,
the largest group after `wbs.md`. It is **outside** every glob in
`check_docs.py`, so this phase has no guard surface at all and is the cheapest
line reduction in the plan.

### Task 7: Retire the audits whose findings are already code

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/reviews/archive/README.md`
- Modify: `docs/README.md`
- Move: audit files into `docs/reviews/archive/`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces: nothing.

- [ ] **Step 1: Classify every review by whether it is still consulted**

```bash
for f in docs/reviews/*.md; do
  n=$(basename "$f" .md)
  hits=$(grep -rl "$n" docs lib test .claude CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v "^docs/reviews/$n.md$" | wc -l)
  printf "%-46s %5d lines  cited by %2d files\n" "$n" "$(wc -l < "$f")" "$hits"
done | sort -k2 -rn
```

An audit cited by nothing but itself is a candidate. An audit cited from
`CLAUDE.md`, a skill, or `docs/design-system/v1-freeze.md` is **not** — those
are load-bearing. Record the classification in the index (Step 3); do not move
anything on a hunch.

- [ ] **Step 2: Move the uncited audits with `git mv`**

```bash
mkdir -p docs/reviews/archive
git mv docs/reviews/<name>.md docs/reviews/archive/<name>.md
```

`git mv`, not `cp` + `rm`: it keeps the rename in history so `git log
--follow` still reaches the original. Move one file per command so a mistake
is one `git mv` back.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the index**

`docs/reviews/archive/README.md`:

```markdown
# Review archive

Audits whose findings have landed and which nothing in the working tree cites
any more. Moved 2026-09-08 (M100.66). Nothing was edited or deleted.

An audit leaves this directory the moment something needs it again — the test
is citation, not age. `docs/reviews/` keeps every audit still referenced by
`CLAUDE.md`, by a skill, or by a design-system contract.

| Audit | Subject | Closed by | Lines |
|---|---|---|---|
| `a7-icon-actions-menu-audit.md` | icon actions and overflow menus | … | 734 |
```

One row per moved file, with the task or PR that consumed its findings taken
from the audit's own header. Where the audit does not say, write `—` rather
than guessing.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify no link broke**

```bash
grep -rn "docs/reviews/" docs lib test .claude CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -v "docs/reviews/archive/" \
  | while IFS=: read -r f n rest; do
      for p in $(echo "$rest" | grep -oE 'docs/reviews/[a-z0-9.-]+\.md'); do
        [ -f "$p" ] || echo "BROKEN $f:$n -> $p"
      done
    done
```

Expected: no output. Any `BROKEN` line means a moved file is still linked —
either move it back or update the link.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the guard and commit**

```bash
python .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet && echo OK
git add -A docs/reviews docs/README.md
git commit -m "docs(reviews): audits nothing cites move to an archive (M100.66)

The test is citation, not age: an audit still referenced by CLAUDE.md, a skill
or a design-system contract stays in the working set. git mv, so --follow
still reaches the original.

## Phase 4 — The three frozen contracts

**Read this before starting Phase 4.** You asked for these in scope and the
plan delivers them, but the measurement does not support splitting them, and
saying so is part of the work:

- `business-rules.md` is **1,218 lines**, `architecture.md` **1,821**,
  `use-cases.md` **1,587**. Together they are 4,626 lines — **less than a
  quarter of `wbs.md` alone**, and Phases 2 and 3 already remove 43,533 lines
  between them.
- All three are `frozen for MVP`. CLAUDE.md: a task must not edit one unless
  the task names it, and the reason is that they are the contract the code is
  written against.
- All three are parsed by name: `BR_FILE`, `AD_FILE`, `UC_FILE` feed
  `_check_document_integrity`, `_check_br_rows`, `_check_section_br`,
  `_check_uc_sections`, `_check_ad_sections`. Splitting them means teaching
  five more guard functions to glob, each with its own fault injection.
- **14,789 citations** resolve against those five functions. A mistake here is
  not a messy diff; it is every BR/AD/UC reference in the repository going
  dangling at once.

**Recommendation: do Task 8 and stop.** It is the part of Phase 4 that is
worth doing on the measurement — it takes the three genuinely oversized
sections out without changing how any ID resolves. Task 9 is written out in
full because you asked for it; run it only if Task 8 leaves you still wanting
the split.

### Task 8: Extract the three oversized architecture sections

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/architecture.md` — AD-14 (313 lines), AD-13 (154), AD-12 (95)
- Create: `docs/design-system/ad-14-color-and-depth.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces: nothing. IDs do not move — only prose does.

**Why this is safe where Task 9 is not:** `_defined_ids(AD_FILE, "AD")` matches
`^(\| |#{2,4} )(AD-[0-9]+)`. The heading `## AD-14 · …` stays in
`architecture.md`; only the *body* under it moves, replaced by a pointer. Every
guard function still finds AD-14 exactly where it looks.

- [ ] **Step 1: Measure the three sections**

```bash
python -X utf8 - <<'PY'
import io, re
lines = io.open('docs/architecture.md', encoding='utf-8').read().split('\n')
h = [(i, l) for i, l in enumerate(lines) if l.startswith('## ')]
for k, (i, l) in enumerate(h):
    end = h[k+1][0] if k+1 < len(h) else len(lines)
    if end - i > 90:
        print(f'{end-i:5d}  line {i+1:5d}  {l[:70]}')
PY
```

Expected: `AD-14` at 313 lines, `AD-13` at 154, `AD-12` at 95. If the numbers
differ, the file has moved since measurement — use what the command prints.

- [ ] **Step 2: Move AD-14's body into the design-system tree**

Create `docs/design-system/ad-14-color-and-depth.md` with the 7-field header
(it lands inside `_docs_md()`'s `docs/design-system/*.md` glob, so the header
is mandatory):

```markdown
# AD-14 · Hệ màu và chiều sâu: seed, role, và cue theo mode

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | frozen for MVP |
| **Purpose** | Giữ toàn văn lý luận của AD-14, tách khỏi `architecture.md` để file đó đọc được |
| **Scope** | Seed, 45 role của `ColorScheme`, cue chiều sâu theo mode. Ngoài phạm vi: quyết định AD khác, giá trị token cụ thể |
| **Source of truth for** | Lý luận đầy đủ của AD-14 — quyết định vẫn được tuyên bố ở `../architecture.md` |
| **Depends on** | `../architecture.md` · `../document-conventions.md` |
| **Updated by task** | M100.67 |
| **Last updated** | 2026-09-08 |

<toàn bộ phần thân AD-14, nguyên văn>
```

`Source of truth for` must **not** repeat a topic `architecture.md` already
claims — `_check_document_contract` fails when two documents claim one topic.
The wording above says "lý luận đầy đủ của AD-14", which `architecture.md` does
not claim.

- [ ] **Step 3: Leave the decision in place, pointing at the reasoning**

In `docs/architecture.md`, `## AD-14 · …` keeps its heading and its first
paragraph — the decision itself — and gains:

```markdown
> Lý luận đầy đủ, các phương án bị loại và số đo: `design-system/ad-14-color-and-depth.md`.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify no citation broke and no topic is claimed twice**

Run: `python .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet`
Expected: exit 0, including
`every cited BR / AD / UC id resolves (315 distinct ids)` — the count must not
change, and
`no topic is claimed as source of truth by two documents`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/architecture.md docs/design-system/ad-14-color-and-depth.md
git commit -m "docs(architecture): AD-14's reasoning moves; its decision stays (M100.67)

313 of architecture.md's 1,821 lines were one AD. The heading and the decision
stay where every guard function and every citation looks for them; only the
reasoning moves.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Repeat Steps 2–5 for AD-13 and AD-12 only if the file still reads long**

Re-run Step 1. `architecture.md` is now ~1,500 lines. If that is short enough,
stop — moving two more sections costs two more files for 249 lines.

### Task 9: Split the three frozen documents (run only if Task 8 was not enough)

**Files:**
- Modify: `.claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py` — `_defined_ids` and five check functions
- Modify: `.claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests/test_check_docs.py`
- Create: `docs/business-rules/*.md`, `docs/architecture/*.md`, `docs/use-cases/*.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `_wbs_ledgers()` as the pattern to copy (Task 4).
- Produces: `_contract_files(kind: str) -> list[str]` where `kind` is `"BR"`,
  `"AD"` or `"UC"`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `test_check_docs.py`:

```python
class ContractFileSetTest(unittest.TestCase):
    """A split contract is still one definition set."""

    def test_the_root_file_is_always_in_the_set(self) -> None:
        self.assertIn("docs/business-rules.md", check_docs._contract_files("BR"))

    def test_a_part_file_joins_without_a_code_change(self) -> None:
        import tempfile, pathlib
        with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:
            root = pathlib.Path(tmp)
            (root / "docs" / "business-rules").mkdir(parents=True)
            (root / "docs" / "business-rules.md").write_text("# x", encoding="utf-8")
            (root / "docs" / "business-rules" / "deck.md").write_text(
                "| BR-01 | active |", encoding="utf-8"
            )
            original = check_docs._REPO
            try:
                check_docs._REPO = root
                files = check_docs._contract_files("BR")
                self.assertIn("docs/business-rules/deck.md", files)
            finally:
                check_docs._REPO = original
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to verify it fails**

Run:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests -p 'test_check_docs.py'
```
Expected: FAIL — `AttributeError: module 'check_docs' has no attribute '_contract_files'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the contract-file glob**

After `_DEF_RE` in `check_docs.py`:

```python
_CONTRACT_ROOT = {"BR": BR_FILE, "AD": AD_FILE, "UC": UC_FILE}


def _contract_files(kind: str) -> list[str]:
    """The root contract document plus its part files.

    Same shape as `_wbs_ledgers`, same reason: a definition set that lives in
    more than one file is only checkable when the guard sees all of it. The
    part directory takes the root's stem — `docs/business-rules/` beside
    `docs/business-rules.md` — so the pairing needs no table.

    Part files land inside `_docs_md()` only if they sit directly under
    `docs/`; these sit one level down, so they inherit no header contract. The
    root keeps the header, and it keeps `Source of truth for`.
    """
    root = _CONTRACT_ROOT[kind]
    files = [root]
    part_dir = _REPO / root[: -len(".md")]
    if part_dir.is_dir():
        files.extend(
            sorted(p.relative_to(_REPO).as_posix() for p in part_dir.glob("*.md"))
        )
    return [f for f in files if (_REPO / f).is_file()]
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Route `_defined_ids` through it**

Replace `_defined_ids(path, prefix)` with a set-aware version:

```python
def _defined_ids(kind: str) -> list[str]:
    """Table rows `| BR-07` and headings `### BR-15 ·`, in document order."""
    pat = _DEF_RE[kind]
    ids: list[str] = []
    for path in _contract_files(kind):
        for line in _lines(path):
            if (m := pat.match(line)):
                ids.append(m.group(2))
    return ids
```

Update its three callers in `_check_document_integrity` from
`_defined_ids(BR_FILE, "BR")` to `_defined_ids("BR")`, and likewise for AD and
UC. Then update `_check_br_rows`, `_check_section_br`, `_check_uc_sections`
and `_check_ad_sections` to iterate `_contract_files(...)` instead of reading
one path.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests and the guard against the unsplit tree**

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests -p 'test_*.py'
python .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected: tests PASS, guard exit 0, and the integrity line still reads
`every cited BR / AD / UC id resolves (315 distinct ids)`. **The count is the
proof**: the refactor is complete only if it changes nothing before any file
moves.

- [ ] **Step 6: Fault-inject**

```bash
mkdir -p docs/business-rules
printf '| BR-01 | active | probe | x | y |\n' > docs/business-rules/_probe.md
python .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet; echo "exit=$?"
rm -r docs/business-rules
```

Expected: exit non-zero, `BR-01 defined more than once`. If it exits 0, the
glob is not reaching the duplicate check.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit the guard refactor alone, before any content moves**

```bash
git add .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py \
        .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/tests/test_check_docs.py
git commit -m "feat(docs-guard): a contract's definition set may span files

_defined_ids read one hardcoded path per kind, so splitting business-rules.md
would have made all 14,789 BR/AD/UC citations dangle at once. Same shape as
_wbs_ledgers: the part directory takes the root's stem.

No file has moved yet, and the id count is unchanged at 315 — which is what
makes this commit reviewable on its own.

```

- [ ] **Step 8: Move one BR section and stop to check**

Move exactly one `##` section of `docs/business-rules.md` — start with
`## StudyMode` (lines 617-683, 67 lines) — into
`docs/business-rules/study-mode.md`, keeping the table's header row:

```markdown
# BR — StudyMode

Tách khỏi `../business-rules.md` ở M100.68. Trạng thái, cách đánh số và quyền
sở hữu không đổi: `../business-rules.md` vẫn là `Source of truth for` của
business rules, và `check_docs.py` đọc cả hai qua `_contract_files("BR")`.

| ID | Status | Rule | Enforced by | Related |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BR-… | … | … | … | … |
```

In `docs/business-rules.md`, the `## StudyMode` heading stays with a pointer
line beneath it, so a reader scanning the contract still finds the topic.

- [ ] **Step 9: Verify, then decide whether to continue**

Run: `python .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet`
Expected: exit 0, still 315 distinct ids, and
`no numbering gap in BR` unchanged.

Then measure the result before moving a second section:

```bash
wc -l docs/business-rules.md docs/business-rules/*.md
```

One section removed 67 of 1,218 lines. **Continue only if that ratio is worth
24 more moves.** If it is not, revert this step and keep the guard refactor —
it is useful on its own and costs nothing.

- [ ] **Step 10: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/business-rules.md docs/business-rules/
git commit -m "docs(business-rules): StudyMode's rules move to a part file (M100.68)

One section, as a probe. The guard's id count is unchanged at 315, which is
the only evidence that a split contract is still one contract.

## Not in the scope you chose — measured after you answered

`docs/prompt/` is **108 files in 36 directories, 8,848 lines**: 12% of the doc
lines but **59% of the doc files**. Every directory is a three-file executable
prompt set for a feature that has shipped. `check_prompt_contract.py` validates
them and CI runs it only when `has_prompt_changes` is true, so an archive
directory would need the same glob treatment as Phase 2.

It is the largest remaining reduction in *file count*, and file count is what
makes a tree hard to navigate. It is listed here rather than planned because
you did not choose it — say the word and it becomes Phase 5, shaped exactly
like Phase 3.

## Expected result

| | Before | After Phases 0–3 | After Phase 4 (Task 8 only) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/wbs.md` | 19,856 lines | ~600 | ~600 |
| `docs/reviews/` working set | 24,221 lines | depends on Step 1's classification | same |
| `docs/architecture.md` | 1,821 lines | 1,821 | ~1,508 |
| Distinct task ids the guard sees | 297 | 320 | 320 |
| Duplicate task IDs | 3, unreported | 0 | 0 |
| BR/AD/UC ids resolving | 315 | 315 | 315 |
| Nothing deleted | — | ✓ | ✓ |

## Self-review

**Spec coverage.** Every item you selected has a task: `docs/wbs.md` + guard →
Tasks 2–6; `docs/reviews/` → Task 7; `business-rules.md` → Task 9 Steps 8–10;
`architecture.md` + `use-cases.md` → Task 8 and Task 9. The three duplicate IDs
→ Task 3, renumbering the `##` copies as you chose. Archive-by-milestone with
content intact → Task 5.

**Placeholder scan.** Two places carry a deliberate `…`: the review-archive
index table (Task 7 Step 3) and the BR part-file table (Task 9 Step 8). Both
are filled from a command given in the same step, because their content is the
output of the classification the step performs — writing rows here would be
inventing them.

**Type consistency.** `_wbs_ledgers()` (Task 4) and `_contract_files(kind)`
(Task 9) are the only new functions; both are defined before first use, both
return `list[str]` of repo-relative POSIX paths, and Task 9's docstring names
Task 4's function as the pattern it copies. `_wrong_level_task_headings`
(Task 2) is called in Task 2 Step 5 and re-pointed at `_wbs_ledgers()` in
Task 4 Step 4 — the only signature that changes across tasks, and the change is
stated in both places.
