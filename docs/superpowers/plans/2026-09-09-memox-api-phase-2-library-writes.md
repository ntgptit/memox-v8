# MemoX API Phase 2 Library Writes Implementation Plan

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | **complete** — all 15 tasks executed and merged 2026-09-10 (PRs #512…#525). Corrections made while executing are marked **[corrected]** in place. |
| **Purpose** | Port the 69 Drift library queries (deck · card · tag · trash) to MyBatis PostgreSQL statements and build the vertical slices that call them. |
| **Scope** | `memox-api` deck, card, tag and trash modules: mapper XML, mapper interfaces, domain records, application services, controllers, DTOs and their tests; plus the two migrations and one test-harness change those slices require. |
| **Source of truth for** | Exact execution steps for MemoX API Phase 2, and the Drift→MyBatis statement mapping for the four library modules. |
| **Depends on** | `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-06-memox-api-design.md` · `docs/business-rules.md` · `docs/data-model.md` · `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-06-memox-api-phase-1-schema.md` |
| **Updated by task** | M9 API Phase 2 |
| **Last updated** | 2026-09-10 |

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` (recommended) or `superpowers:executing-plans` to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Every library behaviour the Flutter app performs against SQLite — reading the deck tree with its counts, listing and filtering cards, managing the tag catalog, and soft-delete / restore / purge — is available over `/api/v1` against PostgreSQL, with the same business rules enforced inside the same transaction.

**Architecture:** One seam per request: `HTTP controller → application service → MyBatis mapper/XML → PostgreSQL`. Controllers validate DTOs, delegate once and choose a status code. Services own the transaction and every rule that needs the data as it stands at the moment of writing. Mappers own SQL only, and all SQL lives in `*_mapper.xml`. The Drift `.drift` files are the **behaviour** source, not code-generation input: SQLite syntax is translated deliberately, statement by statement, under the contract in §2.

**Tech Stack:** Java 17, Spring Boot 3.5, MyBatis (XML mappers), Flyway, PostgreSQL 16/17, Testcontainers *or* a local PostgreSQL test database (see Task 0), JUnit 5, AssertJ, ArchUnit, springdoc-openapi, Lombok.

## 0. What changed under this plan before it ran

This plan was written on 2026-09-09, before three standardisation waves landed. **The code moved; a
plan that still describes the old code is not a neutral document — it is confidently wrong, and it
reads as authoritative.** Every task below has been corrected. What changed, and what it means for
the steps you are about to follow:

| Landed | What it invalidated here | Now |
|---|---|---|
| **M9.W1** (#512) — CI gate, static analysis, coverage floor, dual-backend Postgres harness, `openapi.json` snapshot | Task 0's whole design; Task 15's assumption that no snapshot exists | Task 0 is history, Task 15 regenerates the snapshot |
| **M9.W2** (#513) — `<feature>/api` → `controller` + `dto/{request,response}`, `<feature>/domain` → `entity` + `enums` + `exception` | **Every `Files:` path in Tasks 2–15** — 30 of them | Rewritten. A closed-world ArchUnit rule now fails any class outside the layout, so the old paths cannot be recreated quietly |
| **M9.W3** (#514) — `page`/`size` paging, `PageQuery<TSort>`, `SortSpec`, `SortField`, `PageSlice`, `SortSpecs` | The `#{pageQuery.limit}` XML in Tasks 2 and 7, the `limit=&offset=` endpoint docs, and `CardSort` | Ported statements take `@Param("slice") PageSlice`; sort is an enum whitelist, not a string |
| **Phase 2 prep** (this revision) | Task 0's `MemoxFixtures`, Task 1's handler, Task 5's migration, Task 15's architecture rules | All landed early — see the notes on each task |

**New shared infrastructure you should use rather than reinvent:**

- **`MemoxFixtures`** — the seeding vocabulary, reachable unqualified from any test extending
  `PostgresIntegrationTest`. It writes through `JdbcTemplate` and maintains no invariants on
  purpose, so it can place rows a service would refuse to place.
- **`AffectedRows.requireExactlyOne(rows, supplier)`** — *use this on every UPDATE and DELETE in
  Tasks 6, 9, 10, 12 and 13.* Discarding a mapper's row count makes a write that matched nothing
  look exactly like one that succeeded. Zero rows raises the exception the caller supplies (the
  feature's not-found or conflict); more than one is always an `IllegalStateException`, because a
  single-row write that matched several has a defective WHERE clause and that is never a client's
  fault.
- **`PageHelper.slice(pageQuery, defaultSorts, tieBreaker)` → `PageSlice`** — every list statement
  goes through it. It appends the tie-breaker automatically, which LIMIT/OFFSET needs and which is
  otherwise forgotten once per endpoint. **A query with table aliases must give its sort enum the
  qualified column** (`d.sibling_position`, not `sibling_position`), because the rendered
  `ORDER BY` is inserted verbatim.
- **`V5__defer_deck_sibling_position.sql`** — already applied, so Task 5 no longer creates it.

**Still not built, deliberately:** `IdCollections` (no caller yet — see Task 1) and the
`search` field of the shared paging contract (no statement searches yet; publishing a parameter the
SQL ignores lets a client filter, get everything back, and never know).

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-06-memox-api-design.md`

---

**SQL layout, adopted 2026-09-10 between Task 11 and Task 12.** Every multi-line
list in a mapper statement is comma-first — `SELECT` projections, `INSERT` column
and `VALUES` lists, `SET`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY` — one item per line, the comma
at the head. Function argument lists keep their commas where they are: they are
one expression that wraps, not a list anyone edits a line at a time. The three
existing mappers were converted in one mechanical pass, so the SQL blocks quoted
in tasks below still read comma-last while the files do not. New statements are
written comma-first. See `memox-api/README.md`.

## Global Constraints

- API paths start with `/api/v1`. IDs are client-supplied UUID strings. Times are `Instant`, rendered as UTC ISO-8601.
- **SQL belongs only in `src/main/resources/mybatis/**/*_mapper.xml`.** MyBatis annotation SQL is forbidden. One mapper interface pairs one-to-one with one XML file.
- Flyway owns every schema change under `src/main/resources/db/migration/`. **Applied migrations are immutable** — `V1`…`V4` are already applied locally and MUST NOT be edited. New work adds `V5`, `V6`, …
- Every non-2xx response is RFC 9457 `application/problem+json` produced by the single `@RestControllerAdvice` in `com.memox.common.error.ApiExceptionHandler`. Every new failure gets an `ApiErrorCode` constant **and** an entry in both `messages.properties` and `messages_vi.properties`.
- Auth, sync, and device-only side effects stay out of scope. `owner_id` columns exist and are always `NULL` in this phase; queries that Drift scopes with `owner_id IS :ownerId` are ported with the scope predicate present and bound to `null`, so adding auth later is a binding change and not a query rewrite.
- **Never log card content, note text, tag names, history or transfer payloads at any level** (BR-51, BR-52, BR-267). Diagnostics carry IDs and counts.
- Every production behaviour is introduced by a failing test, then the minimum code, then a passing test. Commit at the end of each task.
- `flutter`-side files are **not** touched by this plan. `lib/` is read-only reference.
- Java style follows the existing code: tab indentation, `final var` locals, records for domain and DTOs, `@RequiredArgsConstructor` for Spring beans, constructor-arg `resultMap`s in XML.

**One place this plan knowingly departs from the spec.** The spec's Phase 2 text says integration tests run "against H2 in PostgreSQL compatibility mode". The code has already moved past that: there is no `src/test/resources/db/test-migration/` any more, `V2`…`V4` are PostgreSQL-only (`TIMESTAMPTZ`, partial unique index on `COALESCE(owner_id, '')`), and `PostgresTestcontainersConfiguration` runs a real `postgres:16-alpine`. Half the statements in this plan — `string_agg`, `json_agg`, row-value comparison, `DEFERRABLE` constraints, `strpos` — are exactly the ones H2's compatibility mode gets wrong or refuses, so testing them on H2 would prove nothing about production. This plan tests on PostgreSQL. **The spec paragraph is now stale and should be corrected in a separate documentation task**, not edited in passing here.

## 2. SQLite → PostgreSQL translation contract

Every ported statement obeys this table. It is the reusable core of the whole plan: get it wrong once and 69 statements repeat the mistake. Task 1 turns rows 1–4 and 9 into executable helpers and a test; every later task cites the row it applied.

| # | SQLite / Drift | PostgreSQL | Why it is not a straight copy |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `GROUP_CONCAT(t.name, char(31))` | `string_agg(t.name, chr(31) ORDER BY t.name, t.id)` | `GROUP_CONCAT` has **no defined order** in SQLite; `string_agg` has none either unless you give it one. Tag strings that reorder between two reads make the Flutter list flicker and make a golden untestable. The explicit `ORDER BY` is the fix, and it matches `tagsForCard`'s own ordering. |
| 2 | `json_group_array(json_object('id', …))` | `COALESCE(json_agg(json_build_object('id', …)), '[]'::json)` | SQLite returns `[]` for an empty set; PostgreSQL returns `NULL`. Without the `COALESCE`, an ancestry path for a level-1 deck deserialises to `null` instead of an empty list and the client's `List<Ancestor>` parse throws. |
| 3 | `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO card_tags …` | `INSERT INTO card_tags … ON CONFLICT (card_id, tag_id) DO NOTHING` | Tag merge (BR-234) links every card of the source tag to the target; cards already carrying both must not fail the batch. |
| 4 | `instr(t.name_folded, :searchFolded) > 0` | `strpos(t.name_folded, #{searchFolded}) > 0` | `instr` does not exist in PostgreSQL. `strpos` has the same 1-based / 0-for-absent contract. |
| 5 | `WHERE parent_deck_id IS :parentDeckId` | `WHERE sibling_scope_id = #{siblingScopeId}` for positions; `WHERE owner_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM #{ownerId}` elsewhere | SQLite's `IS` is a null-safe compare; `=` in PostgreSQL is not. For **sibling scope** the server already resolved this differently and better: `V3` added `sibling_scope_id` (roots use the all-zero sentinel `DeckPositionScope.ROOT_DECKS`) plus `UNIQUE (sibling_scope_id, sibling_position)`. Use the scope column there; use `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` for `owner_id`, which has no such column. |
| 6 | `is_flagged INTEGER … = 1` | `is_flagged SMALLINT … = 1`, bound as `int` | Reading works (`getBoolean` on a smallint yields 0→false/1→true), but **binding a Java `boolean` into a smallint column fails**: `column "is_flagged" is of type smallint but expression is of type boolean`. Task 1 adds one `BooleanSmallIntTypeHandler` so both directions go through one place. |
| 7 | `SELECT parent_id IS NULL AS reachedRoot` | same text, but the column is `boolean` not `0/1` | Map it to `Boolean` in the result record, not `int`. |
| 8 | `ORDER BY t.name ASC` | `ORDER BY t.name_folded ASC, t.id ASC` (already what `tagCatalog` does) | SQLite compares `TEXT` byte-wise; PostgreSQL uses the database collation, so `"Ánh"` vs `"anh"` can order differently. Ordering by the folded column removes the disagreement, and the `id` tie-break makes the page boundary stable. Where Drift orders by raw `name` (`allTags`, `tagsForCard`), keep `name` **and** add `id` — the difference is presentation ordering only, and the tie-break is what pagination needs. |
| 9 | `WHERE id IN :cardIds` | `<foreach collection="cardIds" open="(" separator="," close=")" item="cardId">#{cardId}</foreach>` | PostgreSQL rejects `IN ()`. Every `IN`-collection statement is guarded so an **empty collection never reaches the database** — the service returns early. Task 1's test pins this. |
| 10 | `WITH RECURSIVE x (a) AS (SELECT … UNION SELECT …)` | identical | PostgreSQL supports the same form. Two constraints it adds and SQLite does not: the recursive term may reference the CTE **once**, and may not contain `LIMIT`. No ported query violates either. Referencing the CTE from the outer query (as `childDeckLevel` does, in a scalar sub-select and in a `LEFT JOIN`) is fine. |
| 11 | `DATETIME` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Bind `java.time.Instant`. Never call `now()` / `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` inside a statement — the clock is `java.time.Clock` from `TimeConfiguration`, so a test can pin it. |
| 12 | `SUM(CASE WHEN … THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` over an empty group | returns `NULL` in both | Keep the existing `COALESCE(x, 0)` wrappers. |
| 13 | `ORDER BY x ASC` over a nullable column | `ORDER BY x ASC NULLS FIRST` where the NULL carries meaning | **SQLite sorts NULLs FIRST ascending; PostgreSQL sorts them LAST.** Every ported ORDER BY over a nullable column silently changes meaning — the rows are all still there, in an order that looks plausible. The case that matters is `card_study_states.due_at`: a NULL means a NEW card, due now, so "soonest due first" must put those at the FRONT. The Dart source relies on SQLite's default and says so; PostgreSQL would bury the most urgent cards at the end of the list. Expressed as `NullOrder` on the sort field, because where NULLs belong is a property of what the column MEANS, not of the request. |

## 3. File structure

New and changed files, grouped by responsibility. Each mapper XML stays under 400 lines; when a module's SQL outgrows that, split by aggregate (`deck_mapper.xml` + `deck_tree_mapper.xml`) rather than by statement type.

## Task 0: Make the test suite runnable on this machine

> **DONE — and not the way this task describes.** Everything below was delivered by M9.W1
> (PR #512) and the Phase 2 prep commit, under different names and a better design. Read this

>
> **Still open from this task: nothing.** Start at Task 1.

**Why it existed:** `./mvnw test` on the worktree at the time was **32 tests, 21 errors**. Every error had the same root cause — `PostgresTestcontainersConfiguration` asked Testcontainers for `postgres:16-alpine` and Docker was not installed. Until that was fixed, no step in this plan could run its own verification, and TDD was impossible.

Two further defects in the harness were fixed with it, because the same file was being edited:

- `PostgresIntegrationTest.clearMemoXData` truncated only `decks CASCADE`. `tags`, `card_tags` and `delete_batches` have no FK path from `decks`, so **tag and trash rows leaked between tests** — every Task 9–14 test would have been order-dependent.
- `app_settings` is seeded by `V2` with `id = 1`; a `TRUNCATE … CASCADE` that ever reaches it removes the singleton row. The truncate list must exclude it.

**Files:**
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/support/LocalPostgresConfiguration.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/support/PostgresIntegrationTest.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/test/resources/application-test.properties`
- Modify: `memox-api/pom.xml`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/support/TestDataResetTest.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/support/MemoxFixtures.java`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `PostgresIntegrationTest` — abstract base every integration test extends. Resets all ten MemoX tables between tests and reseeds `app_settings`. Selected backend is chosen by the `memox.test.database` property: `testcontainers` (default, CI) or `local` (developer machines without Docker).
- Consumes: `MEMOX_TEST_DB_URL` / `MEMOX_TEST_DB_USERNAME` / `MEMOX_TEST_DB_PASSWORD` when `memox.test.database=local`.
- Produces: `MemoxFixtures` — the seeding vocabulary every later task's tests use, so no two tasks write two different "make me a deck" helpers. `PostgresIntegrationTest` exposes it as a `protected final MemoxFixtures fixtures` and re-exports the common calls as protected methods, which is why the tests in Tasks 2–14 read `insertRootDeck(...)` with no receiver. Exact signatures:

```java
void insertRootDeck(String id, String name);
void insertRootDeck(String id, String name, SchedulerType schedulerType);
void insertRootDeck(String id, String name, SchedulerType schedulerType, int generation);
void insertSubDeck(String id, String name, String parentId, String rootId);
void insertSubDeck(String id, String name, String parentId, String rootId, DeckContentType contentType);
void insertSubDeckAt(String id, String name, String parentId, String rootId, int siblingPosition);
void insertChain(int levels);                  // "d1".."dN", d1 is the root
void insertCardWithState(String id, String deckId, Instant learnedAt, Instant dueAt);
void insertFlaggedCard(String id, String deckId);
void insertTag(String id, String name);        // name_folded = name.trim().toLowerCase()
void linkTag(String cardId, String tagId);
void softDelete(String itemType, String itemId);   // creates a batch and stamps the one row
void backdateBatch(String batchId, Duration age);
void reviveDeckWithoutBatch(String deckId);
// readers used in assertions
String deckIdOf(String cardId);   String rootDeckIdOf(String deckId);
String batchIdOfDeck(String deckId);   String batchIdOfCard(String cardId);
DeckContentType contentTypeOf(String deckId);   int siblingPositionOf(String deckId);
boolean flaggedOf(String cardId);   boolean cardExists(String id);   boolean deckExists(String id);
boolean tagExists(String id);   List<String> tagIdsOf(String cardId);
```

`MemoxFixtures` writes through `JdbcTemplate`, never through the services under test — a fixture that calls the production write path cannot fail independently of it, and Task 12's "an earlier tombstone is not absorbed" test needs to place a tombstone the service would refuse to place.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

`memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/support/TestDataResetTest.java`:

```java
package com.memox.support;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

import java.time.Instant;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class TestDataResetTest extends PostgresIntegrationTest {

	@Test
	void removesTagAndTrashRowsBetweenTests() {
		jdbcTemplate.update("INSERT INTO tags (id, name, name_folded, created_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
				"11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111", "leak", "leak", Instant.now());
		jdbcTemplate.update("INSERT INTO delete_batches (id, item_type, root_item_id, deleted_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
				"22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222", "card", "33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333", Instant.now());

		resetMemoxData();

		assertThat(jdbcTemplate.queryForObject("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tags", Long.class)).isZero();
		assertThat(jdbcTemplate.queryForObject("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM delete_batches", Long.class)).isZero();
		assertThat(jdbcTemplate.queryForObject("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM app_settings WHERE id = 1", Long.class)).isOne();
	}
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail for the right reason**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=TestDataResetTest test
```

Expected: FAIL — first with the Docker/context error, and after Step 3's datasource change, with `resetMemoxData()` not defined and `tags` still holding a row.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the local-PostgreSQL backend**

`LocalPostgresConfiguration.java`:

```java
package com.memox.support;

import javax.sql.DataSource;

import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.condition.ConditionalOnProperty;
import org.springframework.boot.jdbc.DataSourceBuilder;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.TestConfiguration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.core.env.Environment;

@TestConfiguration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "memox.test.database", havingValue = "local")
public class LocalPostgresConfiguration {

	@Bean
	DataSource dataSource(Environment environment) {
		return DataSourceBuilder.create()
				.url(environment.getRequiredProperty("memox.test.datasource.url"))
				.username(environment.getRequiredProperty("memox.test.datasource.username"))
				.password(environment.getProperty("memox.test.datasource.password", ""))
				.build();
	}
}
```

Guard the Testcontainers bean the same way so exactly one datasource is defined:

```java
@TestConfiguration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "memox.test.database", havingValue = "testcontainers", matchIfMissing = true)
public class PostgresTestcontainersConfiguration { /* unchanged body */ }
```

`application-test.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.hikari.pool-name=memox-test-pool
spring.flyway.locations=classpath:db/migration
memox.test.database=${MEMOX_TEST_DATABASE:testcontainers}
memox.test.datasource.url=${MEMOX_TEST_DB_URL:jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/memox_test}
memox.test.datasource.username=${MEMOX_TEST_DB_USERNAME:giapnt}
memox.test.datasource.password=${MEMOX_TEST_DB_PASSWORD:}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Reset every table, not just `decks`**

`PostgresIntegrationTest.java`:

```java
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@SpringBootTest
@Import({ PostgresTestcontainersConfiguration.class, LocalPostgresConfiguration.class })
public abstract class PostgresIntegrationTest {

	private static final String RESET_TABLES = String.join(", ",
			"study_queue_items", "study_answers", "study_sessions",
			"card_tags", "tags", "card_study_states", "cards", "decks", "delete_batches");

	@Autowired
	protected JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

	@BeforeEach
	void clearMemoxData() {
		resetMemoxData();
	}

	protected void resetMemoxData() {
		jdbcTemplate.execute("TRUNCATE TABLE " + RESET_TABLES + " CASCADE");
		jdbcTemplate.update("UPDATE app_settings SET card_limit = 20, new_card_order = 'created', "
				+ "theme_mode = 'system', language = 'system', reminder_enabled = 0, "
				+ "reminder_minute_of_day = 1200, reminder_last_delivered_at = NULL, updated_at = ? WHERE id = 1",
				java.sql.Timestamp.from(java.time.Instant.EPOCH));
	}
}
```

`app_settings` is deliberately **not** in the truncate list: `V2` seeds its only row, and truncating it would delete the singleton that `V4`'s check constraint assumes.

- [ ] **Step 5: Create the local test database and run the suite**

```bash
psql -U giapnt -h localhost -c "CREATE DATABASE memox_test"
```

```bash
cd memox-api && MEMOX_TEST_DATABASE=local MEMOX_TEST_DB_PASSWORD=<local password> ./mvnw.cmd test
```

Expected: **32 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors.** Flyway creates `V1`…`V4` in `memox_test` on first run. If any pre-existing test fails here it is a real regression from the Docker→local switch and must be fixed before Task 1, not carried.

- [ ] **Step 6: Add `MemoxFixtures` with the signatures above**

Implement every method listed in **Interfaces** against `JdbcTemplate`. Two details that are easy to get wrong and that later tasks depend on:

```java
void insertSubDeckAt(String id, String name, String parentId, String rootId, int siblingPosition) {
    jdbcTemplate.update("""
            INSERT INTO decks (id, name, parent_deck_id, sibling_scope_id, sibling_position,
                               root_deck_id, content_type, created_at, updated_at)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 'unset', ?, ?)""",
            id, name, parentId, parentId, siblingPosition, rootId, EPOCH, EPOCH);
}

void softDelete(String itemType, String itemId) {
    final var batchId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
    jdbcTemplate.update("INSERT INTO delete_batches (id, item_type, root_item_id, deleted_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
            batchId, itemType, itemId, EPOCH);
    final var table = "deck".equals(itemType) ? "decks" : "cards";
    jdbcTemplate.update("UPDATE " + table + " SET delete_batch_id = ? WHERE id = ?", batchId, itemId);
}
```

`sibling_scope_id` must be set on every inserted sub-deck — it is `NOT NULL` with an all-zero default, so a fixture that omits it silently files every sub-deck into the **root** scope and collides with `uq_decks_sibling_scope_position` on the second insert. Roots use `DeckPositionScope.ROOT_DECKS`.

Verify with a fixture self-test that inserts two sub-decks under different parents at position `0` and asserts both exist — that is the assertion that fails if `sibling_scope_id` was forgotten.

- [x] **Step 7: Document the two ways to run the suite** — done, in `memox-api/README.md`.

This step originally said to write it into `memox-api/HELP.md`. That file is **gitignored** (it is Spring Initializr's generated stub), so following the step literally produces a `git add` that silently does nothing and documentation nobody else ever receives. The content lives in `README.md`'s "Running the tests" section instead: CI and any machine with Docker uses the default (`memox.test.database=testcontainers`); a machine without Docker exports `MEMOX_TEST_DATABASE=local` and the three `MEMOX_TEST_DB_*` variables against a database that is **never** the developer's `memox` database.

- [x] **Step 8: Commit** — landed as PR #512 and the Phase 2 prep commit.

---

## Task 1: The translation kit — boolean handler, `IN`-guard and the parity test

> **PARTLY DONE.** The Phase 2 prep commit landed the boolean handler and moved the two
> architecture rules this plan had scheduled for Task 15 forward to here, where they can still
> change what gets written. What each item's state is:
>
> | Item | State |
> |---|---|
> | `BooleanSmallIntTypeHandler` + `mybatis.type-handlers-package` | **done**, with one change from the code drafted below — see the note under it |
> | `sqlLivesOnlyInMapperXml` | **done and live**, moved forward from Task 15. It is `noMethods`, not `noClasses`: MyBatis puts `@Select` on the method, so the drafted class-level check could never fire |
> | `featuresDoNotReachEachOthersInternals` | **done and live**, moved forward from Task 15, renamed, and widened by one allowance the draft could not have anticipated — see Task 15 |
> | `IdCollections.requireNonEmpty` | **deliberately not built yet.** It has no caller until the first `IN`-list statement, and a guard with no call site guards nothing; Wave 3 had just removed `readSchemaVersion` for exactly that. Build it in the task that first needs it — Task 9 — together with the cap below |
> | A batch-size cap for `IN`-list operations | **decided here, because the plan never specified one:** **500 ids** per request for bulk move, bulk flag, bulk delete and restore. Reject a larger list with `VALIDATION_FAILED` rather than truncating it, so a client that exceeds it learns rather than silently loses rows. 500 keeps a single statement's parameter list well under PostgreSQL's 65 535 bind limit even at several parameters per id, and is far above any list a person assembles by hand in the UI |
>
> **One change from the drafted handler, and it matters.** The draft says
> `@MappedJdbcTypes(value = JdbcType.SMALLINT, includeNullJdbcType = true)`. Do not use
> `includeNullJdbcType`: it also makes this the handler for every boolean with no JDBC type
> stated, including `activeDeckExists`, whose `SELECT EXISTS (...)` returns a real PostgreSQL
> BOOLEAN that would then be read with `getShort`. It is bound to SMALLINT only, and statements
> that want it say so — `typeHandler=` on the result-map argument, or `jdbcType=SMALLINT` on the
> bind. `TypeHandlerRegistrationTest` asserts both halves of that.
>
> `@MappedTypes` names **both** `Boolean.class` and `boolean.class`. MyBatis keys its registry on
> the exact class, and the primitive and the wrapper are different keys — the same distinction that
> made `javaType="int"` mean `Integer` and turned every deck creation into an HTTP 500.

**Files:**
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/common/mybatis/BooleanSmallIntTypeHandler.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/common/persistence/IdCollections.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/common/mybatis/BooleanSmallIntTypeHandlerTest.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/common/persistence/IdCollectionsTest.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/resources/application.properties`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `BooleanSmallIntTypeHandler` — registered globally via `mybatis.type-handlers-package`, maps `java.lang.Boolean` ↔ `SMALLINT` 0/1. Used by every `is_flagged`, `used_hint`, `is_revealed` and `reminder_enabled` binding.
- Produces: `IdCollections.requireNonEmpty(Collection<String> ids, String name)` → `List<String>`; throws `IllegalArgumentException` when empty. Every service that is about to call an `IN`-collection statement calls it first.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```java
class BooleanSmallIntTypeHandlerTest {

	private final BooleanSmallIntTypeHandler handler = new BooleanSmallIntTypeHandler();

	@Test
	void writesTrueAsOne() throws SQLException {
		final var statement = mock(PreparedStatement.class);
		handler.setNonNullParameter(statement, 1, Boolean.TRUE, JdbcType.SMALLINT);
		verify(statement).setShort(1, (short) 1);
	}

	@Test
	void readsZeroAsFalse() throws SQLException {
		final var resultSet = mock(ResultSet.class);
		when(resultSet.getShort("is_flagged")).thenReturn((short) 0);
		when(resultSet.wasNull()).thenReturn(false);
		assertThat(handler.getNullableResult(resultSet, "is_flagged")).isFalse();
	}
}
```

```java
class IdCollectionsTest {

	@Test
	void rejectsAnEmptyCollectionBeforeItReachesSql() {
		assertThatThrownBy(() -> IdCollections.requireNonEmpty(List.of(), "cardIds"))
				.isInstanceOf(IllegalArgumentException.class)
				.hasMessageContaining("cardIds");
	}

	@Test
	void returnsAnImmutableCopyInOrder() {
		final var ids = IdCollections.requireNonEmpty(List.of("a", "b"), "cardIds");
		assertThat(ids).containsExactly("a", "b");
		assertThatThrownBy(() -> ids.add("c")).isInstanceOf(UnsupportedOperationException.class);
	}
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them and verify they fail**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest='BooleanSmallIntTypeHandlerTest,IdCollectionsTest' test
```

Expected: FAIL — both classes are missing.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement both**

```java
package com.memox.common.mybatis;

@MappedTypes(Boolean.class)
@MappedJdbcTypes(value = JdbcType.SMALLINT, includeNullJdbcType = true)
public class BooleanSmallIntTypeHandler extends BaseTypeHandler<Boolean> {

	private static final short TRUE_VALUE = 1;
	private static final short FALSE_VALUE = 0;

	@Override
	public void setNonNullParameter(PreparedStatement statement, int index, Boolean parameter, JdbcType jdbcType)
			throws SQLException {
		statement.setShort(index, Boolean.TRUE.equals(parameter) ? TRUE_VALUE : FALSE_VALUE);
	}

	@Override
	public Boolean getNullableResult(ResultSet resultSet, String columnName) throws SQLException {
		final var value = resultSet.getShort(columnName);
		return resultSet.wasNull() ? null : value != FALSE_VALUE;
	}

	@Override
	public Boolean getNullableResult(ResultSet resultSet, int columnIndex) throws SQLException {
		final var value = resultSet.getShort(columnIndex);
		return resultSet.wasNull() ? null : value != FALSE_VALUE;
	}

	@Override
	public Boolean getNullableResult(CallableStatement statement, int columnIndex) throws SQLException {
		final var value = statement.getShort(columnIndex);
		return statement.wasNull() ? null : value != FALSE_VALUE;
	}
}
```

```java
package com.memox.common.persistence;

@UtilityClass
public class IdCollections {

	public List<String> requireNonEmpty(Collection<String> ids, String parameterName) {
		Objects.requireNonNull(ids, parameterName + " must not be null");
		if (ids.isEmpty()) {
			throw new IllegalArgumentException(parameterName + " must not be empty");
		}
		return List.copyOf(ids);
	}
}
```

Register the handler in `application.properties`:

```properties
mybatis.type-handlers-package=com.memox.common.mybatis
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run both tests and verify they pass**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest='BooleanSmallIntTypeHandlerTest,IdCollectionsTest' test
```

Expected: PASS, 4 tests.

- [ ] **Step 5: Prove the handler works against real PostgreSQL**

Add to `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/card/persistence/CardMapperTest.java` (new file, extends `PostgresIntegrationTest`) a test that inserts a card, calls a new `setCardsFlagByIds`-shaped update binding `true`, and reads `is_flagged` back as `1`. This is the test that would have caught `column "is_flagged" is of type smallint but expression is of type boolean` — a mock cannot.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/common memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/common memox-api/src/main/resources/application.properties memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/card/persistence
git commit -m "feat(api): add the smallint boolean handler and the IN-collection guard"
```

## Task 2: Deck tree reads — root summaries, whole tree, one subtree

Ports `rootDeckSummaries`, `allDecks`, `decksInTree`. `rootDeckSummaries` is the single largest read in the app and the one the Library screen depends on; it carries seven aggregate counts plus `nextDueAt`.

**Files:**
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/entity/DeckSummary.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/persistence/DeckMapper.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/resources/mybatis/deck_mapper.xml`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/service/DeckTreeService.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/dto/response/DeckSummaryResponse.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/controller/DeckController.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/deck/DeckSummaryTest.java`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `PageQuery`, `PageHelper`, `Clock` (Task 0's harness).
- Produces: `DeckSummary(String id, String name, String rootDeckId, DeckContentType contentType, SchedulerType schedulerType, int siblingPosition, long totalCardCount, long newCardCount, long dueCardCount, long overdueCardCount, Instant oldestDueAt, long learnedCardCount, long subDeckCount, Instant nextDueAt, Instant createdAt, Instant updatedAt)`.
- Produces: `DeckTreeService.listRootSummaries(PageQuery, Instant now, Instant startOfToday)` → `PagingResponse<DeckSummary>`; `DeckTreeService.listTree(String rootDeckId)` → `List<Deck>`; `DeckTreeService.listAllActive()` → `List<Deck>`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```java
class DeckSummaryTest extends PostgresIntegrationTest {

	@Autowired DeckTreeService deckTreeService;

	@Test
	void countsCardsThroughTheRootDeckAndNotThroughTheImmediateParent() {
		// root -> level2 -> level3, one card in level3 only.
		insertRootDeck("root", "Korean");
		insertSubDeck("level2", "Unit 1", "root", "root");
		insertSubDeck("level3", "Lesson 1", "level2", "root");
		insertCardWithState("card-1", "level3", /* learnedAt */ null, /* dueAt */ null);

		final var page = deckTreeService.listRootSummaries(PageQuery.builder().build(),
				Instant.parse("2026-09-09T00:00:00Z"), Instant.parse("2026-09-09T00:00:00Z"));

		assertThat(page.getItems()).singleElement().satisfies(summary -> {
			assertThat(summary.id()).isEqualTo("root");
			assertThat(summary.totalCardCount()).isEqualTo(1);   // reached via root_deck_id, three levels down
			assertThat(summary.newCardCount()).isEqualTo(1);     // learned_at IS NULL
			assertThat(summary.dueCardCount()).isZero();
			assertThat(summary.subDeckCount()).isEqualTo(1);     // direct children only
		});
	}

	@Test
	void excludesSoftDeletedCardsFromEveryCount() {
		insertRootDeck("root", "Korean");
		insertSubDeck("level2", "Unit 1", "root", "root");
		insertCardWithState("kept", "level2", null, null);
		insertCardWithState("trashed", "level2", null, null);
		softDelete("card", "trashed");

		final var page = deckTreeService.listRootSummaries(PageQuery.builder().build(),
				Instant.parse("2026-09-09T00:00:00Z"), Instant.parse("2026-09-09T00:00:00Z"));

		assertThat(page.getItems()).singleElement()
				.extracting(DeckSummary::totalCardCount, DeckSummary::newCardCount)
				.containsExactly(1L, 1L);   // BR-257
	}
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and verify it fails**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=DeckSummaryTest test
```

Expected: FAIL — `DeckTreeService` does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the statement**

`deck_mapper.xml`, applying translation rows 11 and 12. The five `LEFT JOIN` sub-aggregates and the `nextDueAt` scalar sub-select are copied structurally from `rootDeckSummaries`; only the parameter syntax changes.

**CORRECTED — this paragraph used to call the missing correlation a bug, and it is not one.** `nextDueAt` takes `MIN(due_at)` across the whole database on purpose: it is the earliest instant at which any `dueCardCount` on the page would change, and the list screen schedules its next re-measure from it. It is a screen-level timer delivered on every row, not a per-deck fact, and `deck.drift` says so twice — once above the statement ("one scalar subquery, evaluated once per statement") and once beside `childDeckLevel` ("the whole database is its horizon and the global MIN in `rootDeckSummaries` is correct there"). Correlating it on `root_deck_id` changes the meaning — the screen wakes at the first tree's boundary and is late for the others — and turns one scalar into a per-row correlated sub-query. **Do not add the correlation.** It was added and merged in PR #516 on the strength of this paragraph, and reverted immediately afterwards.

**The real divergence is smaller.** `nextDueAt` also excludes cards whose *deck* is in Trash. Drift joins `cards` alone, so it drops a trashed card but keeps a card sitting in a trashed deck — while every count beside it checks `cd.delete_batch_id`. Drift's own reason covers both ("a state whose card is in Trash must not set the moment this screen wakes up at", BR-257). Record *that* in the parity document (Task 15) with a WBS entry against the Flutter side rather than editing `lib/`.

`findAllActiveDecks` and `findDecksInTree` are direct copies of `allDecks` and `decksInTree` with the existing `deck` result map and the column list already used by `findRootDecks`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the service, DTO and endpoints**

`DeckTreeService.listRootSummaries` is `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` and returns `PageHelper.create(pageQuery, mapper.findRootDeckSummaries(...), mapper.countRootDecks())`. `now` and `startOfToday` come from the controller, which derives them from `Clock` and the request's `X-Utc-Offset-Minutes` header (default `0`) — the server never guesses a local midnight (BR-105).

`GET /api/v1/decks/summaries` returns `PagingResponse<DeckSummaryResponse>`; `GET /api/v1/decks/{rootDeckId}/tree` returns `List<DeckResponse>`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests and verify they pass**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=DeckSummaryTest test
```

Expected: PASS, 2 tests.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

## Task 3: The deck level view — `childDeckLevel` and `deckContextById`

The hardest read in the module: one statement returning the parent, every child, each child's whole-subtree counts via a recursive `branch` CTE, the inherited scheduler, and the parent's ancestry path as JSON. `deckContextById` is the same ancestry shape for a card's deck, so both land here and share one JSON contract.

**Files:**
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/entity/DeckAncestor.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/entity/DeckLevelChild.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/entity/DeckLevel.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/entity/DeckContext.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/service/DeckLimits.java` *(a constants holder; `entity/` is for what the mapper reads back, and the depth ceiling is a rule the service enforces)*
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/persistence/AncestryJsonTypeHandler.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/resources/mybatis/deck_mapper.xml`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/service/DeckTreeService.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/deck/DeckLevelTest.java`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `DeckMapper`, translation rows 2 and 10.
- Produces: `DeckAncestor(String id, String name, int distance)`; `DeckLevelChild(Deck child, SchedulerType inheritedSchedulerType, long totalCardCount, long newCardCount, long dueCardCount, long overdueCardCount, Instant oldestDueAt, long learnedCardCount, long subDeckCount)`; `DeckContext(String deckId, String deckName, DeckContentType contentType, List<DeckAncestor> ancestry)`.
- Produces: `DeckTreeService.readLevel(String deckId, Instant now, Instant startOfToday)` → `DeckLevel(DeckContext parent, List<DeckLevelChild> children, Instant nextDueAt)`; `DeckTreeService.readContext(String deckId)` → `DeckContext`. Both return `null` for a deck that is missing or in Trash.

**CORRECTED — three interface declarations here did not match the statement below them.**

1. `DeckLevel` held a full `Deck parent`, but the SELECT lists three parent columns. The parent is a `DeckContext` now — which is also exactly what `deckContextById` produces, so the two statements this task ports share one shape rather than merely sharing a JSON contract.
2. `DeckLevelChild` held `nextDueAt`. That instant is scoped to the level, not to a child, so it moved to `DeckLevel`. Per-child it would publish a number the statement does not measure.
3. `DeckContext` had no `deckId`, leaving the response unable to say which deck it describes.

**The result map is flat, not nested.** MyBatis can nest a result map inside a constructor argument; this module has already paid once for a mapping mistake that produced no error and no value (`javaType="int"` silently meaning `Integer`), so the row is scalars (`DeckLevelRow`) and the folding is ordinary Java in the service, where it is tested.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```java
class DeckLevelTest extends PostgresIntegrationTest {

	@Autowired DeckTreeService deckTreeService;

	@Test
	void returnsAnEmptyAncestryListForAFirstLevelParent() {
		insertRootDeck("root", "Korean");
		insertSubDeck("level2", "Unit 1", "root", "root");

		final var level = deckTreeService.readLevel("root", NOW, START_OF_TODAY);

		assertThat(level.ancestry()).isEmpty();   // translation row 2: [] and not null
		assertThat(level.children()).singleElement()
				.extracting(child -> child.child().id()).isEqualTo("level2");
	}

	@Test
	void countsACardThatSitsTwoLevelsBelowTheChild() {
		insertRootDeck("root", "Korean");
		insertSubDeck("a", "Unit 1", "root", "root");
		insertSubDeck("b", "Lesson 1", "a", "root");
		insertSubDeck("c", "Set 1", "b", "root");
		insertCardWithState("card-1", "c", null, null);

		final var level = deckTreeService.readLevel("root", NOW, START_OF_TODAY);

		assertThat(level.children()).singleElement()
				.extracting(DeckLevelChild::totalCardCount).isEqualTo(1L);   // branch CTE, not a direct count
	}

	@Test
	void reportsTheAncestryOfADeepParentNearestFirst() {
		insertRootDeck("root", "Korean");
		insertSubDeck("a", "Unit 1", "root", "root");
		insertSubDeck("b", "Lesson 1", "a", "root");

		final var level = deckTreeService.readLevel("b", NOW, START_OF_TODAY);

		assertThat(level.ancestry())
				.extracting(DeckAncestor::id, DeckAncestor::distance)
				.containsExactly(tuple("a", 1), tuple("root", 2));
	}
}

```

The four `branch`-keyed aggregates are what make a child's counts cover its **whole subtree** rather than its direct cards, and `sub` is deliberately *not* branch-keyed: `subDeckCount` is a direct-child count in Drift and stays one here.

`findChildDeckLevel` returns one row per child (or a single row with a null child when the parent is empty), so `DeckTreeService.readLevel` filters the null-child row out before building `DeckLevel`.

**CORRECTED — the same mistake as Task 2, for the same reason.** Reading the whole `branch` CTE is deliberate: this scalar is the level screen's re-measure timer, and `deck.drift` states its scope explicitly — "scoped to this level's subtrees, unlike the root's … the earliest instant at which one of *these* counts changes". Restricting it to `child.id` would turn a screen-level timer into a per-child value and a once-per-statement scalar into a per-row one. **Do not add `AND fb.branch_id = child.id`.** Port the sub-select unchanged.

`AncestryJsonTypeHandler` extends `BaseTypeHandler<List<DeckAncestor>>` and reads the column with a shared `ObjectMapper`; it returns `List.of()` for `null` so a future non-`COALESCE`d caller still cannot NPE.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the endpoint**

`GET /api/v1/decks/{deckId}/level` → `DeckLevelResponse`. `maxWalk` is bound from the existing `MAX_TREE_DEPTH = 10`, promoted to `com.memox.deck.service.DeckLimits.MAX_TREE_DEPTH` so the service, the mapper call and the depth probe in Task 4 read one constant.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests and verify they pass**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=DeckLevelTest test
```

Expected: PASS, 3 tests.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash

## Task 4: Structural probes — depth, height, counts, subtree ids

Replaces `DeckService.depthOf`, which today walks the tree with up to ten separate `SELECT`s inside the write transaction. Drift answers the same question in one recursive statement, and so should the server.

**Files:**
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/entity/DeckDepth.java`
- ~~Modify: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/service/DeckLimits.java`~~ *(both constants landed with Task 3, which needed `MAX_WALK` for its ancestry walks)*
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/persistence/DeckMapper.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/resources/mybatis/deck_mapper.xml`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/service/DeckStructureService.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/service/DeckService.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/deck/DeckStructureTest.java`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `DeckDepth(int depth, boolean reachedRoot)`; `DeckLimits.MAX_TREE_DEPTH = 10`, `DeckLimits.MAX_WALK = 11`.
- Produces: `DeckStructureService.depthOf(String deckId)` → `int`; `.subtreeHeight(String deckId)` → `int`; `.subtreeDeckIds(String deckId)` → `List<String>`; `.directChildDeckCount(String)`, `.directCardCount(String)`, `.subtreeCardCount(String)` → `long`.
- `DeckService.createSubDeck` switches from `depthOf(Deck)` to `deckStructureService.depthOf(parent.id())`.

`MAX_WALK` is `MAX_TREE_DEPTH + 1` on purpose: the probe must be able to *observe* an eleventh level in order to reject it, so a walk capped at ten cannot tell "exactly at the limit" from "over it".

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```java
class DeckStructureTest extends PostgresIntegrationTest {

	@Autowired DeckStructureService deckStructureService;

	@Test
	void reportsRootDepthAsOne() {
		insertRootDeck("root", "Korean");
		assertThat(deckStructureService.depthOf("root")).isEqualTo(1);   // BR-55: root is level 1
	}

	@Test
	void reportsTheTenthLevelAsTen() {
		insertChain(10);   // root + 9 sub-decks, ids "d1".."d10"
		assertThat(deckStructureService.depthOf("d10")).isEqualTo(10);
	}

	@Test
	void reportsSubtreeHeightFromTheGivenNode() {
		insertChain(4);
		assertThat(deckStructureService.subtreeHeight("d2")).isEqualTo(3);   // d2,d3,d4
	}

	@Test
	void countsOnlyActiveCardsInASubtree() {
		insertRootDeck("root", "Korean");
		insertSubDeck("a", "Unit 1", "root", "root");
		insertSubDeck("b", "Lesson 1", "a", "root");
		insertCardWithState("kept", "b", null, null);
		insertCardWithState("trashed", "b", null, null);
		softDelete("card", "trashed");

		assertThat(deckStructureService.subtreeCardCount("a")).isEqualTo(1);   // BR-257
	}
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and verify it fails**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=DeckStructureTest test
```

Expected: FAIL — `DeckStructureService` does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Port the five statements**

```xml
<select id="probeDeckDepth" resultType="com.memox.deck.entity.DeckDepth">

      SELECT d.id, d.parent_deck_id, a.depth + 1
        FROM decks d
        INNER JOIN ancestry a ON d.id = a.parent_id
       WHERE a.depth &lt; #{maxWalk} AND d.delete_batch_id IS NULL
  )
  SELECT depth AS depth, (parent_id IS NULL) AS reached_root
    FROM ancestry
   ORDER BY depth DESC
   LIMIT 1
</select>

<select id="probeSubtreeHeight" resultType="java.lang.Integer">

      SELECT d.id, w.height + 1
        FROM decks d
        INNER JOIN walk w ON d.parent_deck_id = w.id
       WHERE w.height &lt; #{maxWalk} AND d.delete_batch_id IS NULL
  )
  SELECT MAX(height) FROM walk
</select>

<select id="findSubtreeDeckIds" resultType="java.lang.String">
  WITH RECURSIVE subtree (id) AS (
      SELECT id FROM decks WHERE id = #{deckId} AND delete_batch_id IS NULL
      UNION
      SELECT d.id FROM decks d
        INNER JOIN subtree s ON d.parent_deck_id = s.id
       WHERE d.delete_batch_id IS NULL
  )
  SELECT id FROM subtree
</select>

<select id="countDirectChildDecks" resultType="long">
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM decks WHERE parent_deck_id = #{deckId} AND delete_batch_id IS NULL
</select>

<select id="countDirectCards" resultType="long">
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE deck_id = #{deckId} AND delete_batch_id IS NULL
</select>

<select id="countSubtreeCards" resultType="long">
  WITH RECURSIVE subtree (id) AS (
      SELECT id FROM decks WHERE id = #{deckId} AND delete_batch_id IS NULL
      UNION
      SELECT d.id FROM decks d
        INNER JOIN subtree s ON d.parent_deck_id = s.id
       WHERE d.delete_batch_id IS NULL
  )
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards c
   WHERE c.deck_id IN (SELECT id FROM subtree) AND c.delete_batch_id IS NULL
</select>
```

`(parent_id IS NULL)` is a PostgreSQL `boolean` (translation row 7), so `DeckDepth.reachedRoot` is `boolean`, not `int`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Point `DeckService` at the probe**

Delete the `depthOf(Deck)` loop and its `requireActiveDeck` calls; call `deckStructureService.depthOf(parent.id())` instead. The existing `DeckControllerTest.rejectsCreatingAnEleventhDeckLevel` must still pass unchanged — that is the regression gate for this swap.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the deck suite**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest='DeckStructureTest,DeckControllerTest,DeckMapperTest' test
```

Expected: PASS. `rejectsCreatingAnEleventhDeckLevel` still green proves the replacement is behaviour-preserving.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck memox-api/src/main/resources/mybatis/deck_mapper.xml memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/deck

## Task 5: Deck reorder — and the migration it needs

**Blocker discovered while reading the schema.** `V3` added `uq_decks_sibling_scope_position UNIQUE (sibling_scope_id, sibling_position)` and `V4` added `ck_decks_sibling_position_non_negative CHECK (sibling_position >= 0)`. A reorder that shifts a run of siblings collides on the unique index part-way through the run, and the usual escape — park the moved row at a negative position — is blocked by the check. The constraint is not `DEFERRABLE`, and PostgreSQL's `ALTER TABLE … ALTER CONSTRAINT` only re-arms foreign keys, so it must be dropped and re-added.

> **The migration is already applied.** The Phase 2 prep commit landed
> `V5__defer_deck_sibling_position.sql` and two `FlywayMigrationTest` assertions: one that
> `condeferrable` is true, and one that performs a real two-row swap inside a transaction — because
> checking the flag is not the same as checking that PostgreSQL then behaves the way the flag
> promises. Removing V5 makes the second test fail on its *first* UPDATE, which is how it was
> verified. This task now starts at the reorder statement itself.

		insertSubDeckAt("a", "A", "root", "root", 0);

	}

	@Test

		assertThat(group).extracting(Deck::id).containsExactly("c", "a");   // BR-257, BR-268
	}
}
```

The third test is the one that pins the design decision: a soft-deleted sibling keeps its `sibling_position` row and therefore still occupies a slot in the unique index, but it must not occupy a slot in the **user-visible** order. Renumbering active siblings from `0` upward would collide with the tombstone at `1`. The deferred constraint from Step 3 is what makes the collision transient and legal.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and verify it fails**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=DeckReorderTest test
```

Expected: FAIL — `reorderDeck` does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add `V5`**

```sql
ALTER TABLE decks DROP CONSTRAINT uq_decks_sibling_scope_position;

ALTER TABLE decks
    ADD CONSTRAINT uq_decks_sibling_scope_position
    UNIQUE (sibling_scope_id, sibling_position) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
```

A deferred unique constraint is checked at `COMMIT`, so a reorder may pass through a state where two rows share a position as long as the transaction ends consistent. Two consequences to know: `INSERT … ON CONFLICT` cannot target a deferrable constraint (nothing here does), and a violation now surfaces at commit time, so `ApiExceptionHandler` must keep mapping `DataIntegrityViolationException` to `DATA_INTEGRITY_VIOLATION` — it already does.

Add a `FlywayMigrationTest` assertion that the constraint exists and `condeferrable` is true:

```java
@Test
void deckSiblingPositionUniquenessIsDeferrable() {
    final var deferrable = jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(
            "SELECT condeferrable FROM pg_constraint WHERE conname = 'uq_decks_sibling_scope_position'",
            Boolean.class);
    assertThat(deferrable).isTrue();
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the reorder**

```xml
<select id="findSiblingDecksForUpdate" resultMap="deck">
  SELECT id, name, parent_deck_id, root_deck_id, content_type, scheduler_type,
         scheduler_version, scheduler_generation, sibling_position, created_at, updated_at
    FROM decks
   WHERE sibling_scope_id = #{siblingScopeId}
     AND delete_batch_id IS NULL
   ORDER BY sibling_position ASC, id ASC
     FOR UPDATE
</select>

<update id="updateSiblingPosition">
  UPDATE decks SET sibling_position = #{siblingPosition}, updated_at = #{updatedAt}
   WHERE id = #{deckId} AND delete_batch_id IS NULL
</update>
```

`DeckService.reorderDeck` is `@Transactional`: lock the deck, read its group `FOR UPDATE` (BR-268 requires re-reading source and target inside the transaction), reject when `targetPosition` is outside `[0, group.size() - 1]`, rebuild the list with the deck at its new index, then write each row a position.

**CORRECTED — "renumbered densely from `0`" does not work, and this task's own third test is what shows it.** A soft-deleted sibling keeps its `sibling_position` row, so it still holds a slot in `uq_decks_sibling_scope_position` while holding no place in the order a user sees. Renumbering the active siblings from zero walks one of them straight onto the tombstone's slot, and that collision **survives to COMMIT** — a DEFERRABLE constraint makes a *transient* conflict legal, not a final one.

The reorder instead **permutes the positions the active siblings already own**: gather their current positions, sort them, hand them out in the new order. Tombstones keep their slots, the order is dense among active siblings, and the deferred constraint is still required — for the states passed through while the rows are written one at a time.

**The endpoint, which this task never named:** `PUT /api/v1/decks/{deckId}/position`, body `{"targetPosition": n}`, returning the sibling group in its new order. PUT rather than POST because a reorder sets a sub-resource to a value and repeating it changes nothing.

**`DECK_NOT_SIBLING` is NOT added.** With the deck locked before its group is read, its sibling scope cannot change underneath, so no code path can return that error — and an `ApiErrorCode` is a published contract carrying two translations. The impossible case is guarded as an `IllegalStateException`, the same way `AffectedRows` treats a single-row write that matched several.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests and verify they pass**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest='DeckReorderTest,FlywayMigrationTest' test
```

Expected: PASS, 3 + existing.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add memox-api/src/main/resources/db/migration/V5__defer_deck_sibling_position.sql memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck memox-api/src/main/resources memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox

## Task 6: Deck move, rename, and move targets

**Files:**
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/resources/mybatis/deck_mapper.xml`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/persistence/DeckMapper.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/entity/DeckMoveTarget.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/service/DeckMoveService.java`, `MoveDeckCommand.java`, `RenameDeckCommand.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/controller/DeckController.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck/dto/request/MoveDeckRequest.java`, `RenameDeckRequest.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/common/error/ApiErrorCode.java`, both `messages*.properties`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/deck/DeckMoveTest.java`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `DeckStructureService.depthOf`, `.subtreeHeight`, `.subtreeDeckIds` (Task 4).
- Produces: `MoveDeckCommand(String deckId, String targetParentDeckId)`; `DeckMoveService.move(MoveDeckCommand)` → `Deck`; `DeckMoveService.rename(RenameDeckCommand)` → `Deck`; `DeckMoveService.listCardMoveTargets(String rootDeckId, String sourceDeckId)` → `List<DeckMoveTarget>`.
- Produces: `ApiErrorCode.DECK_CROSS_ROOT_MOVE(409, "error.deck-cross-root-move")`, `DECK_MOVE_INTO_OWN_SUBTREE(409, "error.deck-move-into-own-subtree")`, `SCHEDULER_GENERATION_MISMATCH(409, "error.scheduler-generation-mismatch")`.

Rules enforced inside the write transaction, never above the repository: `depthOf(target) + subtreeHeight(source) <= 10` (BR-55); target must not be inside the source's own subtree; the move is refused across roots whose scheduler type, version or generation differ, and never silently converted (BR-73/74); the source's old parent drops to `unset` if it loses its last active child and the new parent rises to `deck` if it was `unset`, both in the same transaction (BR-163, BR-260).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```java
class DeckMoveTest extends PostgresIntegrationTest {

	@Autowired DeckMoveService deckMoveService;

	@Test
	void rewritesRootDeckIdForTheWholeMovedSubtree() {
		insertRootDeck("r1", "Korean", SchedulerType.EIGHT_BOX);

		insertSubDeck("a", "Unit 1", "r1", "r1");
		insertSubDeck("b", "Lesson 1", "a", "r1");
		insertSubDeck("target", "Imported", "r2", "r2");

		deckMoveService.move(new MoveDeckCommand("a", "target"));

		assertThat(rootDeckIdOf("a")).isEqualTo("r2");
		assertThat(rootDeckIdOf("b")).isEqualTo("r2");   // updateSubtreeRootDeck reaches every descendant
	}

	@Test
	void refusesAMoveThatWouldMakeAnEleventhLevel() {

		insertSubDeck("spare", "Spare", "r2", "r2");
		// CORRECTED: d10 is INSIDE d9 own subtree, so this input breaks two rules at once and
		// cannot say which one answers. The shipped test moves a two-high subtree under a deck at
		// depth nine in a DIFFERENT root, where only the depth rule is broken.
		assertThatThrownBy(() -> deckMoveService.move(new MoveDeckCommand("d9", "d10")))
				.isInstanceOf(DeckConflictException.class)
				.extracting("errorCode").isEqualTo(ApiErrorCode.DECK_DEPTH_EXCEEDED);
	}

	@Test
	void refusesAMoveIntoTheDecksOwnSubtree() {
		insertRootDeck("root", "Korean");
		insertSubDeck("a", "Unit 1", "root", "root");
		insertSubDeck("b", "Lesson 1", "a", "root");

		assertThatThrownBy(() -> deckMoveService.move(new MoveDeckCommand("a", "b")))
				.isInstanceOf(DeckConflictException.class)
				.extracting("errorCode").isEqualTo(ApiErrorCode.DECK_MOVE_INTO_OWN_SUBTREE);
	}

	@Test
	void refusesACrossRootMoveWhenTheGenerationDiffers() {
		insertRootDeck("r1", "Korean", SchedulerType.EIGHT_BOX, /* generation */ 1);
		insertRootDeck("r2", "Japanese", SchedulerType.EIGHT_BOX, /* generation */ 2);
		insertSubDeck("a", "Unit 1", "r1", "r1");
		insertSubDeck("target", "Imported", "r2", "r2");

		assertThatThrownBy(() -> deckMoveService.move(new MoveDeckCommand("a", "target")))
				.isInstanceOf(DeckConflictException.class)
				.extracting("errorCode").isEqualTo(ApiErrorCode.SCHEDULER_GENERATION_MISMATCH);
	}
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and verify it fails**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=DeckMoveTest test
```

Expected: FAIL — `DeckMoveService` does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Port the two statements**

```xml
<update id="updateSubtreeRootDeck">
  UPDATE decks
     SET root_deck_id = #{newRootDeckId}, updated_at = #{updatedAt}
   WHERE id IN (
     WITH RECURSIVE subtree (id) AS (
         SELECT id FROM decks WHERE id = #{deckId}
         UNION
         SELECT d.id FROM decks d INNER JOIN subtree s ON d.parent_deck_id = s.id
     )
     SELECT id FROM subtree
   )
</update>

<update id="reparentDeck">
  UPDATE decks
     SET parent_deck_id = #{parentDeckId},
         sibling_scope_id = #{parentDeckId},
         sibling_position = #{siblingPosition},
         updated_at = #{updatedAt}
   WHERE id = #{deckId} AND delete_batch_id IS NULL
</update>

<select id="findCardMoveTargets" resultType="com.memox.deck.entity.DeckMoveTarget">
  SELECT d.id AS deck_id, d.name AS deck_name, d.content_type AS content_type,
         p.name AS parent_name
    FROM decks d
    LEFT JOIN decks p ON p.id = d.parent_deck_id
   WHERE d.root_deck_id = #{rootDeckId}
     AND d.parent_deck_id IS NOT NULL
     AND d.id &lt;&gt; #{sourceDeckId}
     AND d.delete_batch_id IS NULL
     AND d.content_type IN ('unset', 'card')
   ORDER BY d.name ASC, d.id ASC
</select>
```

`updateSubtreeRootDeck` is copied verbatim from Drift including its deliberate omission of `delete_batch_id IS NULL` inside the recursion — a moved subtree must carry its tombstoned descendants' `root_deck_id` too, or restoring one later would place it under the old root.

`reparentDeck` has no Drift counterpart: Drift stores no `sibling_scope_id`. It is the server-side half of translation row 5, and forgetting it is how a moved deck keeps competing for positions in its **old** parent's scope.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the service and endpoints**

`PATCH /api/v1/decks/{deckId}` (rename), `POST /api/v1/decks/{deckId}/move`, `GET /api/v1/decks/{rootDeckId}/card-move-targets`. Rename normalises with `trim()` and validates non-blank / ≤ 200 chars, reusing `ValidationPatterns`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests and verify they pass**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=DeckMoveTest test
```

Expected: PASS, 4 tests.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/deck memox-api/src/main/resources memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/deck
git commit -m "feat(deck): move a subtree, rename a deck and list card move targets"
```

## Task 7: Card list, filter, sort and counts

Ports `cardListItems`, `cardCount`, `cardIdsMatching`, `flaggedCardsByDeck`, `cardStateCountsByDeck`. Drift compiles `$predicate` and `$order` at build time from Dart expressions; MyBatis builds them from a **whitelist** — never from a client-supplied string (spec: "whitelist-based sorting").

**Files:**
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/entity/CardListItem.java`, `CardFilter.java`, `CardStateCounts.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/service/StageThresholds.java`
- **Do not create `CardSort`.** Wave 3 already shipped `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/enums/CardSortField.java` implementing `SortField`; extend that enum with the constants this task needs instead of adding a second sort vocabulary.
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/common/mybatis/UnitSeparatedListTypeHandler.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/persistence/CardMapper.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/resources/mybatis/card_mapper.xml`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/service/CardQueryService.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/dto/response/CardListResponse.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/controller/CardController.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/card/CardListTest.java`

**Interfaces:**
**CORRECTED — this line contradicted the Files list above it, and its DUE_ASC fragment was backwards.**

No `CardSort` enum. Wave 3 shipped `CardSortField implements SortField`, and the module already has one sort vocabulary: a field supplies a column, `SortSpec` supplies a direction, `PageHelper.slice` appends the tie-breaker. A second vocabulary of whole ORDER BY fragments would mean two ways to express one thing, and the plan asked for both on adjacent lines.

`CardSortField` gains `DUE_AT("dueAt", "s.due_at")`. Its columns are now qualified (`c.front_folded`, `c.created_at`, `s.due_at`) because the list statement joins two tables and an unqualified `created_at` is ambiguous there.

**`DUE_ASC("s.due_at ASC NULLS LAST, …")` was the opposite of what the app means** — see translation row 13. A NULL `due_at` is a NEW card, due now, and belongs at the FRONT. Expressed as `NullOrder.FIRST` on the field rather than as text in a fragment.

Two smaller corrections: the plan invented four sorts where the Dart source has two (`newest`, `dueFirst`), so `CREATED_ASC` is not published — an ordering no client asks for is surface with no consumer. And `StageThresholds` lives in `card/entity/`, not `card/service/`: it is a value passed INTO the statement, exactly like `CardFilter`, and a mapper importing from `service` is the wrong direction.
- Produces: `CardFilter(String deckId, boolean includeSubtree, Boolean flagged, List<String> tagIds, String searchFolded)`, with `CardFilter.ofDeck(String deckId)` and `withTagIds(List<String>)` builders. `flagged` is a boxed `Boolean` on purpose: `null` means "don't filter", which a primitive cannot express.
- Produces: `StageThresholds(int reviewingBox, int masteredBox, int reviewingDays, int masteredDays)` with `StageThresholds.DEFAULTS = new StageThresholds(2, 8, 21, 128)` — the same four numbers `cardStateCountsByDeck` is called with on the Flutter side. They are a constant here, not a literal inside SQL, so changing a stage boundary is one edit rather than four.
- Produces: `UnitSeparatedListTypeHandler extends BaseTypeHandler<List<String>>` — splits the column on `chr(31)` (``) and returns `List.of()` for `null` or an empty string.
- Produces: `CardQueryService.list(CardFilter, CardSort, PageQuery)` → `PagingResponse<CardListItem>`; `.idsMatching(CardFilter, CardSort)` → `List<String>`; `.stateCounts(String deckId, StageThresholds)` → `CardStateCounts`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```java
class CardListTest extends PostgresIntegrationTest {

	@Autowired CardQueryService cardQueryService;

	@Test
	void joinsTagNamesInAStableOrder() {

		assertThat(cardQueryService.list(filter, CardSort.CREATED_DESC, PageQuery.builder().build()).getTotalItems())
				.isEqualTo(1);   // BR-231 OR-semantics, BR-252 one row per card
	}

	@Test
	void rejectsAnUnknownSortKeyBeforeItReachesSql() {
		assertThatThrownBy(() -> CardSort.fromValue("c.front; DROP TABLE cards"))

   WHERE <include refid="cardListPredicate"/>
   ORDER BY ${sort.orderBy}
</select>
```

`${sort.orderBy}` is the only `${}` in the whole codebase and it is safe only because `CardSort` is an enum whose fragments are compile-time literals. `CardSort.fromValue` throws on anything else; the controller binds a `CardSort`, never a `String`. `EXISTS` rather than a join is what makes BR-252's "one row per card" true without a `DISTINCT` that would fight the `ORDER BY`.

`tag_names` arrives as one `chr(31)`-separated string; `CardListItem`'s result map binds it through `UnitSeparatedListTypeHandler`, which is also what turns `string_agg`'s `NULL` (a card with no tags) into `List.of()` rather than a null field.

`countCardStatesByDeck` and `findFlaggedCardsByDeck` are direct ports; the four stage thresholds are bound from `StageThresholds`, never written as literals in the XML.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the endpoint**

`GET /api/v1/cards?deckId=&includeSubtree=&flagged=&tagIds=&q=&sort=&page=&size=` → `PagingResponse<CardListResponse>`.

## Task 8: Card detail, study state and review history

Ports `cardById`, `cardDetailById`, `studyStateByCard`, `cardHistoryFirstPage`, `cardHistoryAfter`. History is **read** here; writing it is Phase 3.

**Files:**
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/entity/CardDetail.java`, `CardStudyState.java`, `CardHistoryEntry.java`, `CardHistoryCursor.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/exception/CardNotFoundException.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/persistence/CardMapper.java`, `card_mapper.xml`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/service/CardQueryService.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/dto/response/CardDetailResponse.java`, `CardHistoryResponse.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/controller/CardController.java`
- Modify: `ApiErrorCode.java`, both `messages*.properties`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/card/CardDetailTest.java`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `CardQueryService.detail(String cardId)` → `CardDetail`, throwing `CardNotFoundException` when absent or trashed (BR-245).
- Produces: `CardQueryService.history(String cardId, CardHistoryCursor cursor, int limit)` → `List<CardHistoryEntry>`. `CardHistoryCursor(Instant answeredAt, String id)`; `null` cursor means first page.
- Produces: `ApiErrorCode.CARD_NOT_FOUND(404, "error.card-not-found")`.

Keyset pagination, not offset: `cardHistoryAfter`'s `(answered_at, id) < (:answeredAt, :id)` is stable while rows are appended, which offset pagination is not.

**CORRECTED — four things, all of them found by reading the Drift comments above the statements rather than the statements themselves.**

1. **The projection in Step 3 drops `comparison_version`.** `study_answers` has twenty columns; the plan lists nineteen. Drift uses `SELECT *` there deliberately and says why directly above it: *"a column dropped from a projection is a fact that silently stops being displayed"* (BR-242). Nothing would have failed. The port carries all twenty.
2. **No separate `CardDetail` record.** Drift's own note calls `cardDetailById` *"`cardListItems` narrowed to one id, and deliberately the same shape"*, and gives the reason: detail and the row it was opened from cannot disagree about a card's state or its chips. Two records for one projection is exactly how they would come to disagree. `detail(cardId)` returns `CardListItem`.
3. **`history(...)` returns a page, not a bare list.** Drift: *"The caller asks for one row more than the page size and reports what it found: 'is there another page' answered by the read rather than guessed from a short result."* A bare list leaves the caller inferring, and a page that happens to be exactly full is indistinguishable from the last one. `CardHistoryPage(entries, hasMore)`.
4. **`studyStateByCard` and `cardById` are not ported here.** Neither has a consumer: the detail read already carries the whole study state, and `cardById` is a write-path read that Task 9 needs. Port each in the task that first calls it, rather than shipping two statements nothing reads.

One addition the plan did not specify: half a cursor is refused. `answeredAt` without `cursorId` would silently read as "first page" and repeat rows the client has already shown — the duplicate BR-241 forbids, arriving as a client bug instead of an error.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```java
class CardDetailTest extends PostgresIntegrationTest {

	@Autowired CardQueryService cardQueryService;

	@Test

}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and verify it fails**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=CardDetailTest test
```

Expected: FAIL — `CardQueryService.history` does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Port the statements**

```xml
<select id="findCardHistoryFirstPage" resultMap="cardHistoryEntry">
  SELECT id, card_id, session_id, scheduler_type, scheduler_generation, kind, mode,
         outcome_reason, used_hint, "action", answered_at, next_due_at,
         previous_box, next_box, previous_ease_factor, next_ease_factor,
         previous_interval_days, next_interval_days, direction
    FROM study_answers
   WHERE card_id = #{cardId}
   ORDER BY answered_at DESC, id DESC
   LIMIT #{limit}
</select>

<select id="findCardHistoryAfter" resultMap="cardHistoryEntry">
  SELECT id, card_id, session_id, scheduler_type, scheduler_generation, kind, mode,
         outcome_reason, used_hint, "action", answered_at, next_due_at,
         previous_box, next_box, previous_ease_factor, next_ease_factor,
         previous_interval_days, next_interval_days, direction
    FROM study_answers
   WHERE card_id = #{cardId}
     AND (answered_at, id) &lt; (#{cursor.answeredAt}, #{cursor.id})
   ORDER BY answered_at DESC, id DESC
   LIMIT #{limit}
</select>
```

The row-value comparison `(answered_at, id) < (…, …)` says exactly what Drift's `answered_at < :x OR (answered_at = :x AND id < :y)` says, in one expression PostgreSQL can drive from `idx_study_answers_card`. `"action"` stays quoted — it is a reserved word and `V2` created the column quoted.

`findCardDetailById` reuses the `string_agg` tag projection from Task 7.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the endpoints**

`GET /api/v1/cards/{cardId}` and `GET /api/v1/cards/{cardId}/history?answeredAt=&cursorId=&limit=`. `CardNotFoundException extends MemoxException` and carries `CARD_NOT_FOUND`; `ApiExceptionHandler` needs no change because it dispatches on `ApiErrorCode`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run and verify it passes**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=CardDetailTest test
```

Expected: PASS, 3 tests.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card memox-api/src/main/resources memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/card
git commit -m "feat(card): read card detail, study state and keyset-paged history"
```

## Task 9: Card edit, flag, and bulk move

Ports `cardDeckContextForIds`, `moveCardsToDeck`, `setCardsFlagByIds`, plus the single-card update the app performs through Drift's generated writer.

**Files:**
- Modify: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/persistence/CardMapper.java`, `card_mapper.xml`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/entity/CardDeckContext.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/exception/CardConflictException.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/service/CardEditService.java`, `CardBulkService.java`, `UpdateCardCommand.java`, `BulkMoveCommand.java`, `BulkFlagCommand.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/dto/request/UpdateCardRequest.java`, `BulkMoveRequest.java`, `BulkFlagRequest.java`
- Modify: `CardController.java`, `ApiErrorCode.java`, both `messages*.properties`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/card/CardBulkTest.java`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `IdCollections.requireNonEmpty` (Task 1), `DeckService.prepareCardCreation`'s sibling logic for content-type maintenance.
- Produces: `CardBulkService.move(BulkMoveCommand)` → `int`; `.setFlag(BulkFlagCommand)` → `int`; `CardEditService.update(UpdateCardCommand)` → `Card`.
- Produces: `ApiErrorCode.CARD_CROSS_ROOT_MOVE(409, "error.card-cross-root-move")`, `MOVE_TARGET_INVALID(409, "error.move-target-invalid")`.

BR-165 and BR-166 in one transaction: every card must share the target's root; the target must be non-root with `content_type` in `unset`/`card`; the move writes `deck_id` and `updated_at` only and touches no scheduler column; one violating card rolls the whole batch back; and both the emptied source and the filled target have their `content_type` maintained in the same transaction (BR-163).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```java
class CardBulkTest extends PostgresIntegrationTest {

	@Autowired CardBulkService cardBulkService;

	@Test
	void movesEveryCardAndLeavesTheEmptiedSourceUnset() {
		insertRootDeck("root", "Korean");
		insertSubDeck("src", "Unit 1", "root", "root", DeckContentType.CARD);
		insertSubDeck("dst", "Unit 2", "root", "root", DeckContentType.UNSET);
		insertCardWithState("c1", "src", null, null);
		insertCardWithState("c2", "src", null, null);

		cardBulkService.move(new BulkMoveCommand(List.of("c1", "c2"), "dst"));

		assertThat(deckIdOf("c1")).isEqualTo("dst");
		assertThat(contentTypeOf("src")).isEqualTo(DeckContentType.UNSET);   // BR-163
		assertThat(contentTypeOf("dst")).isEqualTo(DeckContentType.CARD);
	}

	@Test
	void rollsBackTheWholeBatchWhenOneCardBelongsToAnotherRoot() {
		insertRootDeck("r1", "Korean");
		insertRootDeck("r2", "Japanese");
		insertSubDeck("src", "Unit 1", "r1", "r1", DeckContentType.CARD);
		insertSubDeck("other", "Unit 1", "r2", "r2", DeckContentType.CARD);
		insertSubDeck("dst", "Unit 2", "r1", "r1", DeckContentType.UNSET);
		insertCardWithState("ok", "src", null, null);
		insertCardWithState("foreign", "other", null, null);

		assertThatThrownBy(() -> cardBulkService.move(new BulkMoveCommand(List.of("ok", "foreign"), "dst")))
				.isInstanceOf(CardConflictException.class)
				.extracting("errorCode").isEqualTo(ApiErrorCode.CARD_CROSS_ROOT_MOVE);

		assertThat(deckIdOf("ok")).isEqualTo("src");   // BR-166 all-or-nothing
	}

	@Test
	void setsAndClearsTheFlagExplicitlyRatherThanToggling() {
		insertRootDeck("root", "Korean");
		insertSubDeck("deck", "Unit 1", "root", "root", DeckContentType.CARD);
		insertCardWithState("c1", "deck", null, null);
		insertFlaggedCard("c2", "deck");

		cardBulkService.setFlag(new BulkFlagCommand(List.of("c1", "c2"), true));

		assertThat(flaggedOf("c1")).isTrue();
		assertThat(flaggedOf("c2")).isTrue();   // not a toggle derived from the first card
	}
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and verify it fails**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=CardBulkTest test
```

Expected: FAIL — `CardBulkService` does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Port the statements**

```xml
<select id="findCardDeckContextForIds" resultType="com.memox.card.entity.CardDeckContext">
  SELECT c.id AS card_id, d.id AS deck_id, d.root_deck_id AS root_deck_id,
         d.parent_deck_id AS parent_deck_id, d.content_type AS content_type
    FROM cards c
    INNER JOIN decks d ON d.id = c.deck_id
   WHERE c.id IN
     <foreach collection="cardIds" open="(" separator="," close=")" item="cardId">#{cardId}</foreach>
     AND c.delete_batch_id IS NULL AND d.delete_batch_id IS NULL
</select>

<update id="moveCardsToDeck">
  UPDATE cards SET deck_id = #{deckId}, updated_at = #{updatedAt}
   WHERE id IN
     <foreach collection="cardIds" open="(" separator="," close=")" item="cardId">#{cardId}</foreach>
     AND delete_batch_id IS NULL
</update>

<update id="setCardsFlagByIds">
  UPDATE cards SET is_flagged = #{flagged}, updated_at = #{updatedAt}
   WHERE id IN
     <foreach collection="cardIds" open="(" separator="," close=")" item="cardId">#{cardId}</foreach>
     AND delete_batch_id IS NULL
</update>

<update id="updateCardContent">
  UPDATE cards
     SET front = #{front}, back = #{back},
         front_folded = LOWER(#{front}), back_folded = LOWER(#{back}),
         example = #{example}, hint = #{hint}, pronunciation = #{pronunciation},
         updated_at = #{updatedAt}
   WHERE id = #{id} AND delete_batch_id IS NULL
</update>
```

`#{flagged}` binds a Java `boolean` through Task 1's `BooleanSmallIntTypeHandler` — translation row 6. `updateCardContent` writes content columns only and never touches `is_flagged` or any scheduler column (BR-92).

**Fold parity, verified not assumed.** The Dart side folds with `foldForSearch(raw) => raw.trim().toLowerCase()` (`lib/core/text/search_fold.dart:22`). The service already trims before binding, so `LOWER(#{front})` on a UTF-8 database is the same fold for every script the app ships. Add one test asserting `front_folded` for a mixed-case Korean/Latin string matches the Dart result, so the equivalence is pinned rather than believed.

The service calls `IdCollections.requireNonEmpty(cardIds, "cardIds")` before every one of these — translation row 9.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the endpoints**

`PATCH /api/v1/cards/{cardId}`, `POST /api/v1/cards/bulk-move`, `POST /api/v1/cards/bulk-flag`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run and verify it passes**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=CardBulkTest test
```

Expected: PASS, 3 tests.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card memox-api/src/main/resources memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/card
git commit -m "feat(card): edit, bulk move and bulk flag cards in one transaction"
```

## Task 10: The tag module — catalog, rename, merge, delete

All 13 `tag.drift` statements plus `tagsByFoldedNames`, `tagCountsForCards` and `cardsAlreadyTagged` from `card.drift`. New module: `com.memox.tag`.

> **Corrected while executing, 2026-09-10.** Eight things below were wrong or unbuildable as drafted; each correction is marked **[corrected]** where it applies. The short list: no `owner_id` predicate (this API has no principal to fill one), no `TAG_NAME_INVALID` code (that is what `ValidationFailedException` is for), attach is a **batch** endpoint (the three `card.drift` statements it asks to port all take `IN :cardIds`, and BR-166 makes the rule a batch rule), `tagCountsForCards` ports as "which cards are at the ceiling", `orphanedTags` is **not** ported at all, `tagsForCard` **is** ported because without it a client cannot reach the detach endpoint, and the section's own Step 1 test **cannot run** against the unique index.

**Files:**
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/tag/entity/Tag.java`, `TagCatalogEntry.java`, `TagName.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/tag/exception/TagNotFoundException.java`, `TagConflictException.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/tag/persistence/TagMapper.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/resources/mybatis/tag_mapper.xml`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/tag/service/TagCatalogService.java`, `CardTagService.java`, `RenameTagCommand.java`, `AttachTagCommand.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/tag/controller/TagController.java`, `CardTagController.java` *(two, because two resources: `/api/v1/tags` and `/api/v1/cards/**`)*
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/tag/dto/response/TagResponse.java`, `TagCatalogResponse.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/tag/dto/request/RenameTagRequest.java`, `AttachTagRequest.java`
- Modify: `ApiErrorCode.java`, both `messages*.properties`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/tag/TagCatalogTest.java`, `TagMergeTest.java`, `TagControllerTest.java`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `TagName.of(String raw)` -> a final class with a **private** constructor holding `value` and `folded`; `trim()`, rejects blank, > 50 chars, and any control character (BR-93). Validation lives on the type, so the mapper signature answers "has this been validated?". A record cannot express this — Java forbids a canonical constructor less accessible than the record — and a public canonical constructor would let a caller pair a value with somebody else's fold. **[corrected]**
- Produces: `TagName.fold(String raw)` — public, because BR-230 requires the catalog's search term and the column it searches to go through **the same** fold, and a second normaliser is exactly what that rule forbids. **[corrected]**
- Produces: `TagCatalogService.catalog(String search)` -> `List<TagCatalogEntry>`; `.rename(RenameTagCommand)` -> `Tag`; `.delete(String tagId)` -> `void`. The term arrives **unfolded**: folding it is the service's job, once. **[corrected]**
- Produces: `CardTagService.attach(AttachTagCommand)` -> `Tag`; `.detach(String cardId, String tagId)` -> `void`; `.tagsForCard(String cardId)` -> `List<Tag>`. **[corrected]**
- Produces: `ApiErrorCode.TAG_NOT_FOUND(404, "error.tag-not-found")`, `TAG_LIMIT_EXCEEDED(409, "error.tag-limit-exceeded")`.

**`TAG_NAME_INVALID` is not one of them. [corrected]** `ValidationFailedException(field, reason)` already exists for "a parameter this API could not accept, named with the reason", and its own contract says both paths must reach the client as **one** `fieldErrors` shape rather than two. A blank, over-long or control-character tag name is that parameter. A third code would be the second shape that class was written to prevent.

**No `owner_id` predicate anywhere. [corrected]** Drift writes `owner_id IS :ownerId` because the local profile's owner is NULL and `= NULL` never matches. This API has no principal at all (AD-03: "No auth yet, auth-ready"), no other mapper in the codebase carries one, and threading a permanently-null parameter from a controller through a service into every statement would be a fourth spelling of "not yet". The column stays on the table and the unique index over `COALESCE(owner_id, '')` still holds; `Tag` does not carry the field either, for the same reason no other entity does.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

**The version of this test drafted below cannot run. [corrected]** It seeds `insertTag("src", "Alpha")` and `insertTag("dst", "alpha ")` — two rows whose folded name is the same string — into a table carrying `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_tags_owner_folded ON tags (COALESCE(owner_id, ''), name_folded)`. The second insert dies on the constraint before the service is ever called. That is not a fixture problem to work around: **two tags with the same folded name cannot exist**, which is precisely why the collision the merge handles can only ever arise *from* the rename itself. Seed the source under a different name and rename it into the collision.

```java
class TagMergeTest extends PostgresIntegrationTest {

	@Test
	void mergesIntoTheExistingTagWhenTheFoldedNameCollides() {
		insertCardWithState("c1", "deck", null, null);
		insertCardWithState("c2", "deck", null, null);
		insertTag("src", "Bravo");     // NOT "Alpha" — see above
		insertTag("dst", "alpha");
		linkTag("c1", "src");
		linkTag("c2", "src");
		linkTag("c2", "dst");          // already carries both

		assertThat(tagCatalogService.rename(new RenameTagCommand("src", "alpha")).id()).isEqualTo("dst");

		assertThat(tagIdsOf("c1")).containsExactly("dst");
		assertThat(tagIdsOf("c2")).containsExactly("dst");   // ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, row 3
		assertThat(tagExists("src")).isFalse();              // BR-234, one transaction
	}
}
```

Beyond the two cases the plan named, five more that the business rules require and the drafted pair would have let through:

- **BR-237's other half.** The rule has two clauses and the plan quotes one. A hidden card must not count towards the catalog *and* rename/merge **MUST still preserve the tag links of hidden cards so restore loses no metadata**. So `linkCardsOfTagTo` must **not** join `cards` — the opposite of what `findTagCatalog` does, in the same feature, for the same rule.
- **BR-233's case-only rename.** Renaming `alpha` -> `Alpha` leaves `name_folded` unchanged, so the collision probe finds *the tag being renamed*. Comparing ids rather than testing for a row is what stops the merge path deleting the row it was asked to rename.
- **BR-94 at the ceiling**, and the case that proves the rule is measured on the right set: a card already carrying the tag passes however full it is, because it gains nothing.
- **BR-166 all-or-nothing**: a batch refused for one card must leave the *other* card untagged.
- **A trashed card refuses the batch.** `linkTag` would succeed on a tombstoned row — the FK is on `cards` and the tombstone is a column — quietly writing metadata onto a card that reads as gone everywhere else (BR-245, BR-257).

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and verify they fail**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest='TagCatalogTest,TagMergeTest,TagControllerTest' test
```

Expected: FAIL — the `com.memox.tag` package does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Port the statements**

```xml
<select id="findTagCatalog" resultMap="tagCatalogEntry">
  SELECT t.id AS id, t.name AS name,
         (SELECT COUNT(*)
            FROM card_tags ct
            INNER JOIN cards c ON c.id = ct.card_id
           WHERE ct.tag_id = t.id AND c.delete_batch_id IS NULL) AS card_count
    FROM tags t
   WHERE (#{searchFolded} = '' OR strpos(t.name_folded, #{searchFolded}) &gt; 0)
   ORDER BY t.name_folded ASC, t.id ASC
</select>
```

`card_count` binds through a `resultMap` with `javaType="_long"`, not `resultType`: `TagCatalogEntry.cardCount` is a primitive `long`, and MyBatis' registry maps the bare alias `long` to `java.lang.Long`. That mismatch is the one that shipped an HTTP 500 in Wave 1.

`renameTagById`, `linkCardsOfTagTo`, `unlinkAllCardsFromTag`, `deleteTagById`, `findTagByFoldedName` and `findTagById` port as drafted, minus the `owner_id` predicate.

**Three more statements the drafted list did not have:**

```xml
<!-- Which cards are already at BR-94's ceiling. -->
<select id="findCardsAtTagCeiling" resultType="string">
  SELECT ct.card_id FROM card_tags ct
   WHERE ct.card_id IN <foreach .../> GROUP BY ct.card_id HAVING COUNT(*) &gt;= #{ceiling}
</select>

<!-- One tag onto a batch, idempotent by the primary key. -->
<insert id="linkTagToCards">
  INSERT INTO card_tags (card_id, tag_id)
  SELECT c.id, #{tagId} FROM cards c WHERE c.id IN <foreach .../>
  ON CONFLICT (card_id, tag_id) DO NOTHING
</insert>

<!-- The chips on one card, with their ids. -->
<select id="findTagsForCard" resultMap="tag">
  SELECT t.id, t.name, t.name_folded, t.created_at
    FROM card_tags ct INNER JOIN tags t ON t.id = ct.tag_id
   WHERE ct.card_id = #{cardId} ORDER BY t.name ASC, t.id ASC
</select>
```

**`tagCountsForCards` ports as `findCardsAtTagCeiling`. [corrected]** Drift returns a count per card and folds it into the cap check in Dart; the rule only ever asks "which of these is full", so the `HAVING` answers it in the statement and the service compares two id sets instead of a map of numbers nothing else reads.

**`linkTagToCards` replaces the per-card `linkTag` loop. [corrected]** Drift links one row at a time because it has already narrowed the batch to the cards that would gain something; `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` is that same filter, in one statement.

**`findTagsForCard` is not optional, and the plan's own endpoint list is why. [corrected]** `DELETE /api/v1/cards/{cardId}/tags/{tagId}` needs a tag **id**, and every card projection in this API carries tag **names** — `cardListItems`, `cardDetailById` and the export all use the joined-names shape. Without this read a client cannot construct the delete it was given. Turning a name back into an id client-side would put a second fold there, which BR-230 forbids. It orders by the spelling rather than the folded name: this is a display list, and BR-230's folded ordering is the *catalog's* rule because the catalog is also where identity is compared.

**Six statements are deliberately not ported, and Task 15 records each with its reason:**

| Drift statement | Why not |
|---|---|
| `allTags` | `findTagCatalog` with an empty term is the same list and carries the counts. Two list statements would be two orderings of one thing. |
| `tagsForCards` | The card list already carries tag names per row from `card_mapper`; ids are needed on the detail screen only, which `findTagsForCard` serves. |
| `tagCountForCard` | The rule it exists for is BR-94's ceiling, which `findCardsAtTagCeiling` answers directly. |
| `tagCardCount` | "How many cards would lose this tag" is the number the catalog row already carries. |
| `orphanedTags` | **No caller, and a purge would violate BR-230.** Drift says plainly that nothing calls it. More than that: deleting a card cascades its links away and leaves the tag at count 0, and BR-230 requires that row to *stay* — "a tag nothing points at is precisely what the catalog exists to let a user delete". An automatic orphan purge would delete it out from under that. The `NOT IN` -> `NOT EXISTS` note the plan makes is correct and moot. |
| `tagsByFoldedNames` | Import only (`card_import_repository_impl.dart`), and import is not in Phase 2. |

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the endpoints**

`GET /api/v1/tags?q=`, `PATCH /api/v1/tags/{tagId}`, `DELETE /api/v1/tags/{tagId}`, **`POST /api/v1/cards/bulk-tag`**, `GET /api/v1/cards/{cardId}/tags`, `DELETE /api/v1/cards/{cardId}/tags/{tagId}`.

**Attach is a batch endpoint, not `POST /api/v1/cards/{cardId}/tags`. [corrected]** Three things say so and they agree. The statements this task is told to port — `tagCountsForCards`, `cardsAlreadyTagged` — take `IN :cardIds`, and a single-card endpoint would not need either. BR-166 states the rule as a batch rule: *"one card at the ceiling refuses the whole batch"*, which cannot be expressed one card at a time. And the Flutter repository's own single-card path is literally `addTagToCards([cardId])` — one entry point, so the three sub-rules cannot drift apart. It sits beside the `bulk-move` and `bulk-flag` the card module already publishes.

The catalog is **unpaged**: a tag list is bounded by how many names a person invents, and paging the screen whose job is to let a zero-count tag be deleted would put that tag on page four.

`detach` returns 204 and performs **no existence check**, following the Dart comment: *"No existence check: unlinking an absent pair is the same end state."* A second click on a chip that has already gone is not a 404.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run and verify they pass**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest='TagCatalogTest,TagMergeTest,TagControllerTest' test
```

Expected: PASS, 25 tests. Then `./mvnw -o verify` for the full gate, and regenerate `openapi.json` — six endpoints are new.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/tag memox-api/src/main/resources memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/tag memox-api/openapi.json
git commit -m "feat(tag): port the tag catalog, rename-merge and delete"
```

## Task 11: Card export and the import duplicate probe

Ports `exportDeckName`, `exportCardsInDeck`, `exportCardsByIds`, `cardKeysInDeck`. The server exposes the **data**; writing a file is the client's job (spec: no device-only side effects).

> **Corrected while executing, 2026-09-10.** The section ported the SQL and left out most of the rules that govern it. BR-174 has three clauses this task must enforce and the draft named none of them; BR-177's tag ordering was written the wrong way round; and BR-175's line between a content transfer and a backup was drawn in the entity but not in the response. Each correction below is marked **[corrected]**.

**Files:**
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/entity/ExportCard.java`, `CardKey.java`, `DeckExport.java`
- Modify: `card_mapper.xml`, `CardMapper.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/service/CardExportService.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/dto/response/ExportResponse.java`, `ExportCardResponse.java`, `CardKeyResponse.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/dto/request/ExportSelectionRequest.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card/controller/CardExportController.java` — **not** a change to `CardController`, whose class-level path is `/api/v1/decks/{deckId}/cards`; these three endpoints are not under `/cards`. **[corrected]**
- Modify: `ApiErrorCode.java`, both `messages*.properties`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/card/CardExportTest.java`, `CardExportControllerTest.java`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `ExportCard(String cardId, String front, String back, String example, String hint, String pronunciation, List<String> tagNames)` — AD-20's six content fields plus the id. **No `createdAt`. [corrected]** Drift reads it because its selected scope runs in chunks and the concatenation of several ordered statements is not itself ordered; here `IdCollections` caps a batch at 500 against PostgreSQL's 65 535 bind limit, so one statement answers it and its `ORDER BY` is the total order. A field with no reader is surface with no consumer.
- Produces: `CardExportService.exportDeck(String deckId)` -> `DeckExport(String deckName, List<ExportCard> cards)`; `.exportCards(String deckId, Collection<String> cardIds)` -> `DeckExport`; `.existingKeys(String deckId)` -> `Set<CardKey>`. All three `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` (BR-178).
- Produces: `ApiErrorCode.EXPORT_SCOPE_EMPTY(409, "error.export-scope-empty")`, `EXPORT_SELECTION_STALE(409, "error.export-selection-stale")`. **[corrected]** — BR-174 demands a *typed* reason for both refusals and the draft provided neither.

**BR-174 has three clauses, and the draft enforced none of them. [corrected]**

1. **All-or-nothing.** "Một id không còn tồn tại, hoặc không còn thuộc chính deck đó tại thời điểm đọc snapshot, MUST làm **cả request** thất bại bằng lý do có kiểu — MUST NOT export một phần im lặng." Measured by **subtracting the ids that came back from the ids asked for**, never by comparing counts: duplicates are normalised away first, so a short result and a stale id are indistinguishable by count alone. The statement filters on the deck as well as the id, so a deleted card and a card that moved elsewhere are both caught by the one subtraction.
2. **Duplicates normalise to one.** "id trùng MUST được normalize về một lần và MUST NOT nhân bản hàng trong file."
3. **An empty scope is refused, in the repository.** "Scope rỗng (deck không còn card, hoặc tập chọn rỗng) MUST bị từ chối ở domain/repository **kể cả khi UI đã ẩn action**." A deck whose last card was deleted from another screen arrives here with the export button still on screen. An empty selection is refused by `@NotEmpty` on the request; an empty deck by `EXPORT_SCOPE_EMPTY`.

**BR-175 is a rule about the response, not only about the entity. [corrected]** The artifact "MUST chỉ mang sáu field nội dung canonical của AD-20 … MUST NOT mang bất cứ thứ gì khác: id card hay deck, timestamp …". This API's response *is* those cells, so `ExportCardResponse` carries the six and drops the id — matching the Drift comment's "Both stop at the repository". Re-importing the artifact must mint a new card (BR-171), which an id in the payload quietly invites a client to defeat.

The tags travel as a **list**, not a joined cell: BR-176 puts the `;`-with-escapes codec in exactly one place shared by import and export, and that place is the client. An encoder here would be the second copy that rule forbids. Likewise BR-179's six lowercase headers and BR-180's sanitised file name plus date-from-the-client's-clock are properties of the file, which nothing on the server writes.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

The draft's three cases are right and insufficient: they cover the six fields, the Trash exclusion and the empty tag list. Seven more, each attached to a rule the draft did not enforce:

- **BR-177, tags ordered by the folded name** — see below, this is the one that would have shipped wrong.
- **BR-177, cards ordered `created_at ASC, id ASC` in *both* scopes.**
- **BR-174, a descendant deck's cards are excluded** — `deck_id = ?` is a direct-children test.
- **BR-174, a stale selection refuses the whole request** — once for a deleted card, once for a card that moved to a sibling deck.
- **BR-174, a repeated id yields one row.**
- **BR-174, an empty deck and an empty selection are both refused.**
- **A deck that is gone is a 404** — `exportDeckName` returns no row, which is the missing-deck signal.
- **BR-170, the key probe sees active cards only.**
- **BR-175 over HTTP** — the response carries neither `cardId` nor `createdAt` nor the flag.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and verify it fails**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest='CardExportTest,CardExportControllerTest' test
```

Expected: FAIL — `CardExportService` does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Port the statements**

```xml
<sql id="exportCardColumns">
  SELECT c.id AS card_id, c.front, c.back, c.example, c.hint, c.pronunciation,
         (SELECT string_agg(t.name, chr(31) ORDER BY t.name_folded, t.name)
            FROM card_tags ct INNER JOIN tags t ON t.id = ct.tag_id
           WHERE ct.card_id = c.id) AS tag_names
    FROM cards c
</sql>
```

**The draft ordered the tags by `t.name, t.id`, and BR-177 says the folded name. [corrected]** The rule is explicit: *"Tag của mỗi card MUST sắp theo tên đã fold (BR-93) với tie-break ổn định."* Byte-ordered, `Verb` sorts before `adjective`; folded, it does not — so the draft would have produced a different artifact from the Flutter export for the same deck, which is the one thing BR-177 exists to prevent. The tie-break is the raw spelling, matching `_byFoldedThenSpelling` in `card_export_repository_impl.dart`.

**And the ordering belongs in the statement here, which is exactly where Drift cannot put it.** SQLite does not honour an `ORDER BY` inside an aggregate — the comment above `exportCardsInDeck` says so and calls the clause sitting there a courtesy that "read as a guarantee that did not exist" — so the Dart repository re-sorts after splitting. PostgreSQL's `string_agg(… ORDER BY …)` *is* a guarantee, so the rule lives in the SQL that has to keep it. This is deliberately **not** the order `findCardListItems` uses; that one only needs an order that does not flicker, and BR-177 does not govern a screen.

The projection is a shared `<sql>` fragment. Drift pins both scopes to one generated row class with `AS ExportCardRow` for a stated reason — two row shapes would let one grow a column the other lacks — and the fragment is that same guarantee.

```xml
<select id="findExportCardsInDeck" resultMap="exportCard">
  <include refid="exportCardColumns"/>
   WHERE c.deck_id = #{deckId} AND c.delete_batch_id IS NULL
   ORDER BY c.created_at ASC, c.id ASC
</select>

<select id="findExportDeckName" resultType="string">
  SELECT name FROM decks WHERE id = #{deckId} AND delete_batch_id IS NULL
</select>

<select id="findCardKeysInDeck" resultMap="cardKey">
  SELECT front_folded, back_folded FROM cards
   WHERE deck_id = #{deckId} AND delete_batch_id IS NULL
</select>
```

`findExportCardsByIds` is the same fragment with translation row 9's `<foreach>` added. `cardKey` binds through a `resultMap` with `<constructor>` rather than `resultType`, like every other record in this codebase. **[corrected]**

The `exportCard` result map reuses `UnitSeparatedListTypeHandler` from Task 7, which is what makes the empty-tag test pass: `string_agg` over an empty set is `NULL`, and the handler returns `List.of()`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the endpoints**

`GET /api/v1/decks/{deckId}/export`, `POST /api/v1/decks/{deckId}/export` (body carries `cardIds`), `GET /api/v1/decks/{deckId}/card-keys`. All three read-only and logging **counts and ids only** — never a card face, a tag or the deck name, which BR-173 extends to the file name derived from it.

The selected scope is a POST although it mutates nothing. The verb describes how up to 500 ids are carried, not what the request does; BR-178 still applies, down to not clearing the selection it was given.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run and verify it passes**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest='CardExportTest,CardExportControllerTest' test
```

Expected: PASS, 18 tests. Then `./mvnw -o verify`, and regenerate `openapi.json` — three endpoints are new. Both response records holding a `List` need a compact-constructor `List.copyOf`, or SpotBugs fails the build on `EI_EXPOSE_REP`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/card memox-api/src/main/resources memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/card memox-api/openapi.json
git commit -m "feat(card): expose deck export data and the import duplicate probe"

## Task 12: Trash — soft-delete

New module `com.memox.trash`. Ports `activeSubtreeDeckIds`, `activeCardIdsInDecks`, `markDecksDeleted`, `markCardsDeleted`, plus the `delete_batches` insert.

> **Corrected while executing, 2026-09-10.** The section's `deleteCards` signature breaks a MUST: BR-256 requires **one batch per item root**, so a batch delete of fifty cards opens fifty batches, not one. Four smaller gaps besides, and one obligation this API cannot yet meet and must therefore record. Each is marked **[corrected]**.

**Files:**
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/trash/entity/DeleteBatch.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/trash/enums/TrashItemType.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/trash/persistence/TrashMapper.java`, `TrashItemTypeTypeHandler.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/resources/mybatis/trash_mapper.xml`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/trash/service/TrashDeleteService.java`, `DeleteDeckCommand.java`, `DeleteCardsCommand.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/trash/controller/TrashController.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/trash/dto/response/DeleteBatchResponse.java`, `dto/request/DeleteCardsRequest.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/trash/TrashDeleteTest.java`, `TrashDeleteControllerTest.java`

`TrashConflictException` is **not** created here. **[corrected]** Nothing in the delete path conflicts: a deck already in Trash is a `DeckNotFoundException` and a card already in Trash is a `CardNotFoundException`, both because the caller is describing a database that has moved on. Tasks 13 and 14 create it when restore and purge give it something to mean.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `DeckService.lockActiveDeck` / `.markContentType` (Task 9), `DeckStructureService` (Task 4), `IdCollections` (Task 1).
- Produces: `DeleteBatch(String id, TrashItemType itemType, String rootItemId, Instant deletedAt)`.
- Produces: `TrashDeleteService.deleteDeck(DeleteDeckCommand)` -> `DeleteBatch`; **`.deleteCards(DeleteCardsCommand)` -> `List<DeleteBatch>`. [corrected]**

**One batch per item root, and the draft's single return value breaks it. [corrected]** BR-256: *"Xoá nhiều item cùng lúc MUST tạo một batch cho mỗi item root, MUST NOT gộp thành một batch chung — mỗi item root là một thứ người dùng khôi phục được riêng."* The Flutter repository says the same thing in the same words:

> **One batch per card, not one per action** (BR-256). The item root is singular, and a user who deletes fifty cards may want three of them back — which a shared batch could not give them without inventing a partial restore that BR-262 does not have.

One action is still one instant: every batch it opens carries the same `deleted_at`.

BR-256/258/260 in one transaction: exactly one batch row per item root with one `deleted_at`; every **active** descendant deck and card is stamped with it; a descendant already tombstoned from an earlier batch keeps its old batch and is not absorbed; and a non-root parent that just lost its last active direct child drops to `unset`.

**Three checks the draft did not specify. [corrected]**

1. **The item root must be active before a batch is opened.** A deck already in Trash has no row in `findActiveSubtreeDeckIds`, and a card already in Trash refuses the stamp. Either way the answer is not-found, and nothing is written — a batch with no rows is a Trash entry the user can see and cannot act on, because restoring it would revive nothing.
2. **A short mark count rolls the transaction back.** The ids were read inside this transaction from rows that were active then, so a row refusing the stamp is not a race — it is a batch that would claim rows it does not hold.
3. **A tombstone in the deck is not content.** BR-260's last sentence, and it is what makes `directChildDeckCount`/`directCardCount` the right pair to ask: both count active rows only.

**BR-259 is an obligation this API cannot yet meet, and it must be recorded rather than assumed. [corrected]** A session in progress that touches deleted content MUST be closed **in this same transaction** with `status = invalidated` and `end_reason = content_deleted`. `trash.drift` says in as many words why it is not a Trash statement:

> Session invalidation (BR-259) is **not** here. The two lookups and the write live in `queries/study.drift`, because the session status × end_reason pair belongs to `StudySessionStatus.isValidWith` and Trash may not write it behind that enum's back; it asks `StudyRepository` instead.

There is no study module in this API yet, so the delete path is incomplete by exactly that one write. Task 15 records it as an outstanding obligation, and the study slice must add it **to** this transaction rather than beside it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

The draft's four cases are right, with `deleteCards` returning a list. Six more, each attached to a rule the draft did not enforce:

- **BR-256, one batch per card** — two cards, two batch ids, each stamped on its own card.
- **BR-256, one `deleted_at` for the whole action.**
- **BR-260 for a deleted sub-deck**, not only for deleted cards — the draft tested the card path alone.
- **BR-260 ignoring a tombstone** when measuring whether the deck is empty.
- **A deck already in Trash is a 404.**
- **One card already in Trash refuses the whole action**, and the other card keeps no batch.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and verify it fails**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest='TrashDeleteTest,TrashDeleteControllerTest' test
```

Expected: FAIL — the `com.memox.trash` package does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Port the statements**

`insertDeleteBatch`, `findActiveSubtreeDeckIds`, `findActiveCardIdsInDecks`, `markDecksDeleted`, `markCardsDeleted` port as drafted, comma-first (see §0). Two more the draft did not have: **[corrected]**

```xml
<!-- Which of these ids still name an active card, so a batch is never opened over a tombstone. -->
<select id="findActiveCardIds" resultType="string">
  SELECT id FROM cards
   WHERE id IN <foreach .../> AND delete_batch_id IS NULL
</select>

<!-- The decks these cards are leaving, read BEFORE the marking. -->
<select id="findSourceDeckIdsOfActiveCards" resultType="string">
  SELECT DISTINCT deck_id FROM cards
   WHERE id IN <foreach .../> AND delete_batch_id IS NULL
</select>
```

The second one exists because **the order is load-bearing**: `countDirectCards` counts active cards, so once the cards are stamped there is nothing left to say where they lived. Read the sources before the write, count the emptiness after it — both inside one transaction, or they describe two different databases.

The `AND delete_batch_id IS NULL` on both `UPDATE`s is Drift's own guard and the whole of BR-258's "keeps its old tombstone".

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the endpoints**

`DELETE /api/v1/decks/{deckId}` returns **201** with one `DeleteBatchResponse`; `POST /api/v1/cards/bulk-delete` returns **201** with a **list** of them, one per card. **[corrected]** 201 rather than 204 because a soft-delete does not remove a thing — it creates the delete batch an undo or a restore later acts on (BR-263), and a 204 would leave a client nothing to undo with. Neither logs a name or a card face (BR-267).

- [ ] **Step 5: Run and verify it passes**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest='TrashDeleteTest,TrashDeleteControllerTest' test
```

Expected: PASS, 15 tests. Then `./mvnw -o verify`, and regenerate `openapi.json` — two endpoints are new.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/trash memox-api/src/main/resources memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/trash memox-api/openapi.json
git commit -m "feat(trash): soft-delete a deck subtree or a batch of cards"
```

## Task 13: Trash — list and restore

Ports `trashBatchRows`, `batchById`, `tombstoneDeckInBatch`, `tombstoneCardInBatch`, `restoreDecksInBatch`, `restoreCardsInBatch`, and the batch delete.

> **Corrected while executing, 2026-09-10.** The section's central design note rests on a premise that is false, and its validation rule is a **second rule set for restore** — the one thing BR-261 forbids by name. Both are replaced below, and three gaps are filled. Each is marked **[corrected]**.

**The design question the section raises, answered differently. [corrected]** It says: *"V5's unique `(sibling_scope_id, sibling_position)` still covers tombstoned decks, so a restored deck's old position may now be occupied by a sibling created after the delete."* It cannot be. A tombstone keeps its `sibling_position`, and `nextSiblingPosition` is `MAX(sibling_position) + 1` over **every** row in the scope, tombstones included — so the slot was never released and nothing could have taken it.

A restored deck does take a fresh position, but for a different and better reason: **a restore is a move**, and a move always takes the next free slot in the target scope. Which brings us to the rule the section missed.

**Restore runs the move; it does not re-check the move's rules. [corrected]** BR-261: *"Target của một sub-deck MUST thoả **đúng** bộ luật của move (BR-55 độ sâu, BR-63/BR-64 loại nội dung, BR-70/BR-74 scheduler và generation của root) — MUST NOT có bộ luật thứ hai dành riêng cho restore."* The section proposes `depthOf(target) + probeBatchSubtreeHeight(root, batch) <= 10`, which is one of those four rules re-implemented in a second place — precisely what the MUST NOT names.

The port instead **clears the batch's tombstones first and then calls `DeckMoveService.move` / `CardBulkService.move` on rows that are active again.** The rules are not re-listed or translated; they are executed. A refusal rolls the transaction back, so the rows return to being tombstones and the failure reads as "nothing happened". Two consequences worth stating:

- **`batchSubtreeHeightProbe` and `anyDeckById` are not ported.** Once the batch is clear, `DeckMoveService` measures the height over rows that are active again — and a descendant still in Trash under an *older* batch is correctly excluded, because it is not coming back with this restore.
- **The refusals are the move's own codes**: `DECK_DEPTH_EXCEEDED`, `PARENT_HOLDS_CARDS`, `DECK_CROSS_ROOT_MOVE`, `CARD_CROSS_ROOT_MOVE`. Translating them into private restore codes would be the second rule set wearing a different hat. `RESTORE_TARGET_INVALID` is left for the one thing only a restore can get wrong: the **level**.

**Files:**
- Modify: `trash_mapper.xml`, `TrashMapper.java`, `TrashController.java`, `ApiErrorCode.java`, both `messages*.properties`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/trash/entity/TrashBatchRow.java`, `TombstoneDeck.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/trash/exception/TrashNotFoundException.java`, `TrashConflictException.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/trash/service/TrashRestoreService.java`, `RestoreBatchCommand.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/trash/dto/response/TrashBatchResponse.java`, `TrashOriginStepResponse.java`, `dto/request/RestoreBatchRequest.java`
- Move: `DeckAncestor.java` and `AncestryJsonTypeHandler.java` -> `com.memox.common.tree` **[corrected]**
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/trash/TrashRestoreTest.java`

**`TrashOrigin` is not an enum. [corrected]** The origin path is a list of `{id, name, distance}`, which is the same shape the deck breadcrumb reads — so the *entity* moves to `common.tree.DeckAncestor` (two features read it now, exactly as `SchedulerType` did in Task 7) while the *response* stays each feature's own: `TrashOriginStepResponse`. The architecture guard said this first, and it was right — a response is a wire contract, and borrowing another feature's ties this endpoint to changes made for a deck screen.

The handler moves to `common.tree` rather than `common.mybatis` deliberately: that package is auto-scanned by `mybatis.type-handlers-package`, and an unannotated `BaseTypeHandler<List<X>>` resolves against the raw `List` — which would offer this handler for every list MyBatis ever maps.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `TrashBatchRow(String batchId, TrashItemType itemType, String rootItemId, Instant deletedAt, String itemName, String originDeckId, String originDeckName, long batchDeckCount, long batchCardCount, List<DeckAncestor> originPath)`.
- Produces: `TrashRestoreService.list()` -> `List<TrashBatchRow>`; `.restore(RestoreBatchCommand)` -> `void`.
- Produces: `RestoreBatchCommand(String batchId, String targetDeckId)`, where **`targetDeckId == null` means the top level** — a real target, and the only one a root deck may use (BR-56). No other item may use it: promoting a sub-deck would need a scheduler of its own, which is a decision rather than a restore, and the top level holds no cards at all. **[corrected]**
- Produces: `ApiErrorCode.RESTORE_TARGET_INVALID(409, "error.restore-target-invalid")`, `BATCH_NOT_FOUND(404, "error.batch-not-found")`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

The section's four cases stand, with the position case reading "a fresh slot at the end of the group" and the depth case restoring from a **second tree** so it breaks the depth rule and only the depth rule. Twelve more, each on a rule the section did not cover — most importantly:

- **BR-262's root rewrite.** *"Restore một deck MUST viết lại `root_deck_id` cho **toàn bộ** subtree của nó, gồm cả tombstone nằm bên trong."* The section does not mention it. It comes free from `updateSubtreeRootDeck`, whose CTE carries no active filter — but only if a test says so, because nothing else would notice a tombstone left naming the wrong root until the day it is restored itself. **[corrected]**
- **The three move refusals**, each breaking exactly one rule.
- **A root deck restores to the top level and nowhere else**; a sub-deck and a card are both refused there.
- **The target learns what it holds** in the same transaction (BR-62, BR-163).
- **The batch row is gone** once its rows are back — an empty Trash entry is one the user cannot act on.
- **The list counts the batch, not the subtree**, and its origin path runs through a trashed ancestor.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and verify it fails**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=TrashRestoreTest test
```

Expected: FAIL — `TrashRestoreService` does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Port the statements**

`findTrashBatchRows` ports as drafted (comma-first, and carrying `root_item_id` so a caller can tell what the batch is about), plus `findBatchById`, `findTombstoneDeckInBatch`, `findTombstoneCardIdInBatch`, `restoreDecksInBatch`, `restoreCardsInBatch` and `deleteBatch`.

Three things the list statement gets right that are easy to lose. The `ancestry` CTE walks **every** deck, not just the batch's — it has to, because the origin of a trashed item is a deck that may itself be trashed. `origin_path_json` goes through translation row 2, so a top-level item yields `[]` and not `null`. And `COALESCE(d.name, c.front)` returns a card face: it is sent to the owner in the response and **never** written to a log (BR-267). A row whose item root has vanished matches neither exclusive join, yields a null name, and is dropped rather than drawn as a ghost.

**`deleteBatch` runs last, and only after the rows are clear. [corrected]** Both tombstone columns carry `ON DELETE CASCADE` to `delete_batches`, so deleting the batch while its rows still name it would take them with it — a restore that hard-deletes what it was restoring.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the endpoints**

`GET /api/v1/trash` and `POST /api/v1/trash/{batchId}/restore` (204; body optional, and an absent `targetDeckId` is the top level).

- [ ] **Step 5: Run and verify it passes**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=TrashRestoreTest test
```

Expected: PASS, 16 tests. Then `./mvnw -o verify`, and regenerate `openapi.json` — two endpoints are new.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add memox-api/src/main/java memox-api/src/main/resources memox-api/src/test/java memox-api/openapi.json
git commit -m "feat(trash): list batches and restore one into a chosen target"
```

## Task 14: Trash — retention purge

Ports `eligibleBatches`, `purgeBlockerCount`, `purgeBatch`. Retention is 30 x 24 h from `deleted_at`, and the exact boundary is eligible (BR-264).

> **Corrected while executing, 2026-09-10.** The section's own instruction about `V6` was followed to its conclusion and the answer was no. Everything else stands; three cases were added.

**Files:**
- ~~Create: `V6__add_trash_indexes.sql`~~ — **measured and dropped, see below. [corrected]**
- Modify: `trash_mapper.xml`, `TrashMapper.java`, `TrashController.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/trash/service/TrashPurgeService.java`, `RetentionPolicy.java`, `PurgeReport.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/trash/dto/response/PurgeReportResponse.java`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/trash/TrashPurgeTest.java`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `RetentionPolicy.RETENTION = Duration.ofDays(30)`; `RetentionPolicy.cutoff(Instant now)` -> `now.minus(RETENTION)`.
- Produces: `TrashPurgeService.purgeExpired()` -> `PurgeReport(int purgedBatches, int skippedBatches)`; idempotent, safe on every trigger.

**The user-requested purge is not built here.** BR-266's "purge exactly these, with a strong confirmation" is the other caller of the same three statements, and it differs in one behaviour: a blocked batch is **refused** rather than skipped, because the user named it. It has no endpoint in this plan. `countPurgeBlockers` still takes the allowed set as a **parameter** rather than deriving it from the cutoff, so that second caller needs no statement change — which is exactly the reason `trash.drift` gives for the parameter.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

The section's three cases stand. Four more:

- **A day short of the window is not eligible** — the other side of the boundary the first case pins.
- **The cascade reaches the study state and the tag links** (BR-265), asserted rather than assumed: `purgeBatch` deletes one row and nothing in the Java says what follows it.
- **A descendant in a batch that is not *yet* eligible blocks its ancestor.** This is what makes `allowedBatchIds` load-bearing: measuring against "is it deleted" instead would let the ancestor's cascade take a tombstone whose own thirty days have not run out.
- **Both eligible: the descendant goes and the ancestor follows** — the case that proves the skip is not permanent.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and verify it fails**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=TrashPurgeTest test
```

Expected: FAIL — `TrashPurgeService` does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Port the statements** (`V6` measured and dropped)

`findEligibleBatches`, `countPurgeBlockers` and `deleteBatch` port as drafted, comma-first.

`purgeBatch` deletes only the batch row; every tombstoned deck and card carries `delete_batch_id ... ON DELETE CASCADE`, so the rows and their `card_study_states`, `study_answers`, `study_queue_items` and `card_tags` follow through the FK graph (BR-265).

**`V6` was measured and is not shipped. [corrected]** The section said to add the two partial indexes *only* after `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` on data at real scale shows the plan change, and to drop the migration otherwise. The measurement ran on a seeded database of 10 000 decks in a 100-wide fan-out, 100 000 cards, and a tenth of both tombstoned:

| query | before | after `idx_*_active` |
|---|---|---|
| `countDirectCards` | Bitmap Index Scan on `idx_cards_deck_created`, 13 buffers, 0.098 ms | Bitmap Index Scan on `idx_cards_deck_active`, 12 buffers, 0.118 ms |
| `countDirectChildDecks` | Bitmap Index Scan on `idx_decks_parent_position`, 102 buffers, 0.403 ms | Bitmap Index Scan on `idx_decks_parent_active`, 102 buffers, 0.141 ms |

**Both queries were already index-driven before the migration**, and stayed the same node type with the same buffer count after it. The section's premise — that `idx_decks_parent_position` "cannot answer without also reading the tombstones" — is true and turns out not to matter: at a 10% tombstone rate the extra heap rows cost nothing measurable, and the remaining timing spread is cache warmth rather than a plan change. So the migration is dropped, per the section's own instruction. Two indexes nothing uses would be two indexes every write pays for.

The first attempt at this measurement was itself wrong and is worth recording: it gave all 10 000 decks the same parent, so the predicate matched every row and PostgreSQL correctly chose a sequential scan both before and after. A flat seed measures the seed, not the index.

- [ ] **Step 4: Wire the trigger points**

`purgeExpired()` runs at the start of `GET /api/v1/trash` and is exposed as `POST /api/v1/trash/purge-expired` for the client's start and resume hooks (BR-264). No scheduler bean — the server does not own the app lifecycle, and BR-264 requires the sweep to run whether or not anyone opens Trash, which only the client can act on.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run and verify it passes**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest='TrashPurgeTest,FlywayMigrationTest' test
```

Expected: PASS, 7 + existing.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add memox-api/src/main/java/com/memox/trash memox-api/src/main/resources/mybatis/trash_mapper.xml memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/trash memox-api/openapi.json
git commit -m "feat(trash): purge batches past the thirty-day retention window"

## Task 15: The parity document, the OpenAPI snapshot and the WBS

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-09-drift-to-mybatis-parity.md`
- Create: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/contract/DriftParityTest.java`
- Modify: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/contract/OpenApiContractTest.java`
- Regenerate: `memox-api/openapi.json` *(via `OpenApiSnapshotTest`; do not hand-edit)*
- Modify: `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/architecture/LayerArchitectureTest.java`
- Modify: `docs/wbs.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: the parity document — one row per ported statement: Drift name, MyBatis id, translation rows applied, and **every deliberate divergence with its reason**. It is the answer to "was this SQL ported faithfully?" that reading 69 statements cannot give.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```java
class DriftParityTest {

	private static final Path DRIFT_QUERIES = Path.of("..", "lib", "core", "database", "queries");
	private static final Set<String> PHASE_2_FILES = Set.of("deck.drift", "card.drift", "tag.drift", "trash.drift");
	private static final Set<String> DEFERRED = Set.of("resetTreeStudyStates");

	@Test
	void everyPhase2DriftQueryIsAccountedForInTheParityDocument() throws IOException {
		final var accountedFor = new HashSet<>(parityDocumentQueryNames());
		accountedFor.addAll(DEFERRED);

		final var declared = driftQueryNames();
		assertThat(declared).isNotEmpty();

		final var missing = new TreeSet<>(declared);
		missing.removeAll(accountedFor);
		assertThat(missing).as("Drift queries with no parity row").isEmpty();
	}

	@Test
	void everyDocumentedStatementExistsInAMapperXml() throws IOException {
		final var mapperIds = mapperStatementIds();
		assertThat(parityDocumentStatementIds()).isSubsetOf(mapperIds);
	}
}
```

This is the test that makes the mapping a **checked** artifact instead of a claim. Adding a Drift query later without a parity row turns the suite red, which is the only mechanism that keeps this document true after the branch merges.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and verify it fails**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd -Dtest=DriftParityTest test
```

Expected: FAIL — the parity document does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the parity document**

One table with the 68 ported statements (69 minus the deferred `resetTreeStudyStates`), plus a **Deliberate divergences** section recording the four found while porting:

1. ~~`rootDeckSummaries.nextDueAt`~~ — **withdrawn.** The uncorrelated sub-select is deliberate: the comment above it calls it the list screen's re-measure timer, *"one scalar subquery, evaluated once per statement"*. Correlating it shipped in PR #516 and was reverted in #517. Record it here as a divergence that was tried and was wrong, so nobody re-derives it from the SQL alone.
2. ~~`childDeckLevel.nextDueAt`~~ — **withdrawn**, same reason, caught before it shipped.
3. `tagCatalog.cardCount` — Drift counts `card_tags` rows without excluding trashed cards, which BR-237 forbids; the port joins `cards`. This one has a MUST behind it, unlike the two above. Raise a WBS entry against the Flutter query.
4. ~~`orphanedTags`~~ — **not ported at all** (Task 10): no caller, and an automatic orphan purge would violate BR-230, which requires a zero-count tag to keep its row.
5. `tagCountsForCards` -> `findCardsAtTagCeiling` — a count per card becomes the question the rule actually asks.
5b. `exportCardsInDeck` / `exportCardsByIds` tag ordering — Drift orders inside the aggregate as a documented non-guarantee and re-sorts in Dart by folded name; the port puts BR-177's order in the statement, where PostgreSQL can actually keep it.
6. Six `card.drift`/`tag.drift` statements answered by another statement rather than ported one-for-one, listed with their reasons in Task 10.
7. **Not a divergence but an outstanding obligation: BR-259's session invalidation.** A soft-delete MUST close an in-progress session touching the deleted content, in the same transaction, with `status = invalidated` and `end_reason = content_deleted`. `trash.drift` states plainly that the write belongs to `study.drift` because the status x end-reason pair is the study module's invariant; this API has no study module, so the delete path is incomplete by exactly that one write. Record it as a gap, not as a difference of opinion.
5. `nextSiblingPosition` — Drift filters `delete_batch_id IS NULL`; the server must not, because `uq_decks_sibling_scope_position` covers tombstones too.

Each divergence names the BR it serves and, for 1–3, gets a WBS entry against the Flutter query so the client is fixed rather than the server quietly disagreeing with it.

- [ ] **Step 4: Extend the contract and architecture tests**

Add to `OpenApiContractTest` an assertion that every new path is published under `/api/v1` and that each documents its `409` Problem Details response.

**Both architecture rules that used to live in this step have moved to Task 1 and are already
live.** Adding them here would have been too late to matter: a rule introduced after tag and trash
are built can only report what was already written, and the whole point of `CardService → DeckMapper`
being illegal is that nobody writes it in the first place.

Two things changed in the move, and both were found by injecting a fault rather than by reading:

- `sqlLivesOnlyInMapperXml` is `noMethods().that().areDeclaredInClassesThat()…`, not `noClasses()`.
  MyBatis puts `@Select` on the **method**, so the class-level form drafted here compiles, reads
  correctly and can never fire — a rule that would have passed green for the rest of the project.
- `featuresDoNotReachEachOthersPersistence` is now `featuresDoNotReachEachOthersInternals`, and its
  allowance is wider than "service-to-service" because service-to-service is not expressible on its
  own: `DeckService.prepareCardCreation` returns a `DeckSchedulerState` and a `SchedulerType`, so
  `CardService` *necessarily* depends on `deck.entity` and `deck.enums`. The published surface is
  therefore service + entity + enums + exception, reachable only **from** a `..service..` package.
  Another feature's `persistence`, `controller` and `dto` stay closed to everyone.

**Snapshot ownership.** This step's Files list still names `OpenApiContractTest`. That class is a
smoke test over four paths; the byte-for-byte snapshot is owned by `OpenApiSnapshotTest`, which
M9.W1 added along with `memox-api/openapi.json` and the
`./mvnw -Dmemox.openapi.write=true -Dtest=OpenApiSnapshotTest test` regeneration command. New paths
need no change to that class — regenerate the snapshot and commit the diff, because **that diff is
the contract change**.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the whole suite and the docs gate**

```bash
cd memox-api && ./mvnw.cmd test
```

```bash
py -3 .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet
```

Expected: all backend tests pass; the document contract stays valid.

- [ ] **Step 6: Update the WBS and commit**

Add the Phase 2 rows to `docs/wbs.md` — one per task, marked done, with the divergence follow-ups recorded as open Flutter-side entries. Flip the plan header's `Status` to `complete`.

```bash
git add docs/superpowers memox-api/src/test docs/wbs.md
git commit -m "docs(api): record the Drift to MyBatis parity contract for phase 2"
```

## 7. Deliberately out of scope

Named here so a later reader can tell "not done" from "decided against".

| Drift queries | Where they belong | Why not now |
|---|---|---|
| `resetTreeStudyStates` (deck.drift) | **Phase 3** | The spec assigns "scheduler selection/reset" to Phase 3. Reset increments `scheduler_generation`, which every study write must then be checked against; shipping the reset without the check it protects is worse than shipping neither. |
| `study.drift` — 21 queries | **Phase 3** | Session lifecycle, queue serving, answer recording, append-only history writes. |
| `search.drift` — 1 query | **Phase 4** | Library search with keyset pagination across four fields (BR-247, BR-252). |
| `progress.drift` — 3 queries | **Phase 4** | Overview and per-deck activity reads. |
| `settings.drift` — 5 queries | **Phase 4** | Persisted global settings. |
| `reminder.drift` — 3 queries | **Phase 4** | `reminderWorkloadPerRootDeck` is a server-computable read; the notification scheduling it feeds is device-only and stays on the client. |

Also out of scope, and not a gap: auth (`owner_id` stays `NULL`), sync bookkeeping, and any endpoint that would write a file on the server.

## 8. Definition of Done

- All 69 Phase 2 Drift statements have a parity row, and every row that names a MyBatis statement names one that exists and is exercised against a real PostgreSQL. **Ten are deliberately not ported**, each with its reason in the parity document — an unported statement with a reason is a decision, one with no row is something nobody noticed.
- `./mvnw test` is green — every test, not a selected subset — on both test backends (Testcontainers where Docker exists, local PostgreSQL otherwise).
- `V5` applies cleanly from an **empty** database and `FlywayMigrationTest` asserts the deferrable constraint. **`V6` was measured and dropped** (Task 14): both queries it targeted were already index-driven, so the migration would have added two indexes nothing uses and every write pays for.
- Every new failure has an `ApiErrorCode`, an English message and a Vietnamese message, and is reachable in a controller test asserting the Problem Details body.
- `LayerArchitectureTest` passes — eight rules, including the two that moved to Task 1 and the closed-world layout rule; no `@Select`/`@Insert`/`@Update`/`@Delete` annotation exists anywhere.
- `OpenApiSnapshotTest` passes against the committed `openapi.json`, and that snapshot is regenerated in the same commit as any path change. `OpenApiContractTest` stays what it is — a smoke test that the four original paths and `info.title` are still published.
- No endpoint, service or mapper logs card content, tag names, deck names, history or export payloads at any level.
- `docs/wbs.md` carries one row per task, and the ten divergences plus the two outstanding obligations are recorded with their Flutter-side follow-ups.
- `py -3 .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/check_docs.py --quiet` is clean.
