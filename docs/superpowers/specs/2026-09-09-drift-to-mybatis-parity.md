# Drift → MyBatis parity, Phase 2

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | active |
| **Scope** | `deck.drift`, `card.drift`, `tag.drift`, `trash.drift` — the library reads and writes |
| **Companion** | `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-09-memox-api-phase-2-library-writes.md` |
| **Enforced by** | `memox-api/src/test/java/com/memox/contract/DriftParityTest.java` |

The Flutter client and `memox-api` implement the same business rules against the same schema, one in
SQLite through Drift and one in PostgreSQL through MyBatis. This document is the mapping between
them: which statement answers which, what had to change on the way, and — the part a reader cannot
get by reading 69 statements — **where the two deliberately disagree, and why**.

It is checked rather than asserted. `DriftParityTest` fails if a Phase 2 Drift query has no row
here, if a row names a MyBatis statement that does not exist, or if a mapper statement has no row.
Adding SQL on either side without a line in this table turns the suite red, which is the only thing
that keeps a document like this true after its branch merges.

## How to read the table

**MyBatis id `—`** means the statement was **not ported**, and the note says why. That is not the
same as "not done": an unported statement with a reason is a decision, an unported statement with no
row is something nobody noticed. This document exists to make the second impossible.

**Translation rows** cite the SQLite → PostgreSQL contract in §2 of the plan. Row 13 was added while
executing Task 7 and is worth repeating here because nothing fails when it is wrong: **SQLite sorts
NULLs first ascending; PostgreSQL sorts them last.**

## 1. `deck.drift`

| Drift statement | MyBatis id | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `rootDecks` | `findRootDecks`, `countRootDecks` | Paged read plus its total; Wave 3 pagination. |
| `rootDeckSummaries` | `findRootDeckSummaries` | `nextDueAt` is an **uncorrelated** sub-select on purpose — see divergence 1. |
| `allDecks` | `findAllActiveDecks` | |
| `deckById` | `findActiveDeckById`, `findActiveDeckByIdForUpdate` | Two statements because a write path needs `FOR UPDATE` and a read path must not take the lock. |
| `decksInTree` | `findDecksInTree` | Flat, ordered by `sibling_position, id` — not a tree walk. |
| `childDeckLevel` | `findChildDeckLevel` | Recursive branch + ancestry walk; translation row 2 for the JSON breadcrumb. |
| `nextSiblingPosition` | `nextSiblingPosition` | See divergence 5: the filter differs, and it must. |
| `siblingDecks` | `findSiblingDecksForUpdate` | |
| `cardMoveTargets` | `findCardMoveTargets` | Ordered by name, not by id. |
| `subtreeDeckIds` | `findSubtreeDeckIds` | Cycle-safe `UNION`, no depth cap. |
| `deckDepthProbe` | `probeDeckDepth` | Bounded walk; hitting the bound is refused, never rounded down. |
| `subtreeHeightProbe` | `probeSubtreeHeight` | Same contract, other direction. |
| `directChildDeckCount` | `countDirectChildDecks` | Active rows only (BR-260). |
| `directCardCount` | `countDirectCards` | Active rows only (BR-260). |
| `subtreeCardCount` | `countSubtreeCards` | |
| `updateSubtreeRootDeck` | `updateSubtreeRootDeck` | Crosses tombstones deliberately (BR-262). |
| `resetTreeStudyStates` | — | **Phase 3.** Reset increments `scheduler_generation`, which every study write is then checked against; shipping the reset without the check it protects is worse than shipping neither. |

## 2. `card.drift`

| Drift statement | MyBatis id | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `cardsByDeck` | `findActiveCardsByDeck`, `countActiveCardsByDeck` | |
| `cardListItems` | `findCardListItems` | Dynamic predicate; `EXISTS` for tags so a card with three selected tags appears once (BR-231). |
| `cardCount` | `countCardListItems` | Shares the predicate fragment with the list — one vị từ, two statements. |
| `cardIdsMatching` | `findCardIdsMatching` | Unpaged: "select all" means all of the filter (BR-167). |
| `cardDeckContextForIds` | `findCardDeckContextForIds` | |
| `moveCardsToDeck` | `moveCardsToDeck` | |
| `setCardsFlagByIds` | `setCardsFlagByIds` | Translation row 6: the boolean handler is named explicitly. |
| `tagCountsForCards` | `findCardsAtTagCeiling` | **Divergence 5.** |
| `cardsAlreadyTagged` | `findCardsAlreadyTagged` | |
| `cardById` | `findCardById` | |
| `cardDetailById` | `findCardDetailById` | Deliberately the same shape as the list row, so detail and the row it was opened from cannot disagree. |
| `cardHistoryFirstPage` | `findCardHistoryFirstPage` | All twenty `study_answers` columns — see divergence 8. |
| `cardHistoryAfter` | `findCardHistoryAfter` | Keyset pagination on `(answered_at, id)`. |
| `studyStateByCard` | — | No Phase 2 caller: `findCardDetailById` already carries the study state, and a standalone read of it is a study concern. |
| `flaggedCardsByDeck` | — | Answered by `findCardListItems` with its flagged filter. A second statement would be a second place for the list predicate to drift. |
| `cardStateCountsByDeck` | `countCardStatesByDeck` | |
| `deckContextById` | `findDeckContext` | Lives in `deck_mapper.xml`: it reads `decks`, whichever feature asked. |
| `cardKeysInDeck` | `findCardKeysInDeck` | Active cards only (BR-170). |
| `tagsByFoldedNames` | — | Import only, and import is Phase 3. |
| `exportDeckName` | `findExportDeckName` | Read in the same transaction as the rows (BR-177). |
| `exportCardsInDeck` | `findExportCardsInDeck` | **Divergence 6** on the tag order. |
| `exportCardsByIds` | `findExportCardsByIds` | Same projection fragment as above, by construction. |

## 3. `tag.drift`

| Drift statement | MyBatis id | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tagByFoldedName` | `findTagByFoldedName` | No `owner_id` predicate — see divergence 7. |
| `allTags` | — | `findTagCatalog` with an empty term is the same list and carries the counts. Two list statements would be two orderings of one thing. |
| `tagsForCard` | `findTagsForCard` | Ordered by the spelling: this is a display list, and BR-230's folded order is the catalog's rule. |
| `tagsForCards` | — | The card list already carries tag names per row; ids are needed on the detail screen only. |
| `tagCountForCard` | — | The rule it serves is BR-94's ceiling, which `findCardsAtTagCeiling` answers directly. |
| `tagCatalog` | `findTagCatalog` | **Divergence 3.** |
| `tagById` | `findTagById` | |
| `tagCardCount` | — | The catalog row already carries that number. |
| `renameTagById` | `renameTagById` | Only the two name columns; `card_tags` is never touched. |
| `linkCardsOfTagTo` | `linkCardsOfTagTo` | Translation row 3: `INSERT OR IGNORE` → `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. Deliberately does **not** join `cards` (BR-237's second clause). |
| `unlinkAllCardsFromTag` | `unlinkAllCardsFromTag` | Explicit, not left to the cascade. |
| `deleteTagById` | `deleteTagById` | |
| `orphanedTags` | — | **Divergence 4.** |

## 4. `trash.drift`

| Drift statement | MyBatis id | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `trashBatchRows` | `findTrashBatchRows` | One ancestry walk for the whole list, not one per row. Translation row 2. |
| `batchById` | `findBatchById` | |
| `eligibleBatches` | `findEligibleBatches` | `<=` cutoff, oldest first (BR-264). |
| `batchDeckIds` | — | No caller: restore and purge act by batch id, and the counts come from `findTrashBatchRows`. |
| `batchCardIds` | — | Same. |
| `activeSubtreeDeckIds` | `findActiveSubtreeDeckIds` | The active filter on the recursive step is BR-258's "keeps its old tombstone". |
| `activeCardIdsInDecks` | `findActiveCardIdsInDecks` | |
| `batchSubtreeHeightProbe` | — | **Divergence 2**: restore runs the move, which measures the height itself. |
| `purgeBlockerCount` | `countPurgeBlockers` | Allowed set is a parameter, not the cutoff — one statement, two policies. |
| `tombstoneDeckInBatch` | `findTombstoneDeckInBatch` | |
| `tombstoneCardInBatch` | `findTombstoneCardIdInBatch` | Narrowed to the id: the restore path needs existence, not the row. |
| `anyDeckById` | — | **Divergence 2**: the move reads the roots itself, from rows that are active again. |
| `markDecksDeleted` | `markDecksDeleted` | |
| `markCardsDeleted` | `markCardsDeleted` | |
| `restoreDecksInBatch` | `restoreDecksInBatch` | |
| `restoreCardsInBatch` | `restoreCardsInBatch` | |
| `purgeBatch` | `deleteBatch` | One row; both tombstone columns cascade from it. |

## 4b. `study.drift` — the sliver BR-259 requires

Session lifecycle, queue serving and answer recording are Phase 3. These three are not: they are an
obligation of the *delete* path, which shipped in Phase 2 without them.

| Drift statement | MyBatis id | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `openSessionIdsForDecks` | `findOpenSessionIdsForDecks` | Sessions opened on a deck in the deleted set. |
| `openSessionIdsForCards` | `findOpenSessionIdsForCards` | Sessions whose queue holds a deleted card — the half a deck-side lookup cannot see, and the reason there are two statements. |
| `—` | `invalidateSessions` | The close-write. Drift issues it as a generated Companion update per session id; here it is one set-based statement, which is the same atomic step in one round trip. |

The remaining eighteen `study.drift` statements stay out of scope (§7).

## 5. Statements this API has and Drift does not

Drift writes through generated companions, so an insert or a narrow update has no `.drift` query to
map to. These exist only on the server, and they are listed so the table describes the whole mapper
rather than a subset of it.

| Drift statement | MyBatis id | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `—` | `insertRootDeck`, `insertSubDeck` | |
| `—` | `lockRootDeckCreation` | Serialises root creation so two requests cannot claim one sibling position. |
| `—` | `updateSiblingPosition`, `reparentDeck`, `updateDeckName`, `updateContentType` | One column family each; a wide update is how an edit silently touches a schedule. |
| `—` | `insertCard`, `insertInitialStudyState` | BR-09 creates both in one transaction. |
| `—` | `activeDeckExists` | |
| `—` | `updateCardContent` | Content and its folded columns together; never the flag, never the schedule (BR-92). |
| `—` | `insertTag` | |
| `—` | `countActiveCardsByIds`, `findActiveCardIds` | Batch guards: a tombstoned id must refuse the request rather than be skipped. |
| `—` | `linkTagToCards`, `unlinkTag` | Drift links one row at a time from Dart; one statement with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` is the same filter. |
| `—` | `findSourceDeckIdsOfActiveCards` | Read **before** the marking, because the emptiness count runs after it. |
| `—` | `insertDeleteBatch` | |

## 6. Deliberate divergences

Each names the rule it serves. Two of them are **withdrawn** — recorded because they were tried and
were wrong, and a reader who re-derives them from the SQL alone would make the same mistake.

### 1. ~~`rootDeckSummaries.nextDueAt`~~ — withdrawn

Drift's sub-select is uncorrelated and returns the same instant for every root deck. That looks like
a bug and is not: the comment above it calls it the list screen's re-measure timer, *"one scalar
subquery, evaluated once per statement"*, and a sibling comment says *"the global MIN in
`rootDeckSummaries` is correct there"*. Correlating it shipped in PR #516 and was reverted in #517.

**The lesson, recorded because it cost a release:** the design lives in the comment above the SQL,
not in the SQL. Nothing failed when it was "fixed" — every row was still there, with a plausible
value.

### 2. ~~`childDeckLevel.nextDueAt`~~ — withdrawn

The same defect on the level view, caught before it shipped.

### 3. `tagCatalog.cardCount` — active cards only

Drift counts `card_tags` rows without joining `cards`, so a card sitting in Trash keeps inflating its
tags' counts. **BR-237 forbids it**, and the port joins `cards` on `delete_batch_id IS NULL`.

The rule has a second clause the plan did not quote: rename and merge **MUST still preserve the tag
links of hidden cards** so a restore loses no metadata. So `linkCardsOfTagTo` deliberately does *not*
join `cards` — two statements in one feature pulling opposite ways, for one rule.

**Flutter follow-up:** `tagCatalog` should join `cards`. Recorded in `docs/wbs.md`.

### 4. `orphanedTags` — not ported

Nothing calls it, and an automatic orphan purge would **violate BR-230**: deleting a card cascades
its links away and leaves the tag at count 0, and that row must stay — *"a tag nothing points at is
precisely what the catalog exists to let a user delete"*. The `NOT IN` → `NOT EXISTS` improvement the
plan noted is correct and moot.

### 5. `tagCountsForCards` → `findCardsAtTagCeiling`

Drift returns a count per card and folds it into the cap check in Dart. The rule only ever asks
*which of these is full*, so `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10` answers it in the statement and the service
compares two id sets instead of a map of numbers nothing else reads (BR-94, BR-166).

### 6. Export tag ordering — the rule moves into the statement

BR-177: *"Tag của mỗi card MUST sắp theo tên đã fold (BR-93) với tie-break ổn định."*

SQLite does not honour an `ORDER BY` inside an aggregate — the comment above `exportCardsInDeck` says
so and calls the clause sitting there a courtesy that *"read as a guarantee that did not exist"* — so
the Dart repository re-sorts by folded name after splitting. PostgreSQL's `string_agg(… ORDER BY …)`
**is** a guarantee, so the port puts the rule in the statement that has to keep it:
`ORDER BY t.name_folded, t.name`.

The plan specified `ORDER BY t.name, t.id`, which is the spelling rather than the fold. Byte-ordered,
`Verb` sorts before `adjective`; folded, it does not — so the two platforms would have produced
different artifacts for the same deck, which is the one thing BR-177 exists to prevent.

This is deliberately **not** the order `findCardListItems` uses: that one needs an order that does
not flicker between two reads, and BR-177 does not govern a screen.

### 7. `owner_id` is not a predicate anywhere

Drift writes `owner_id IS :ownerId` because the local profile's owner is NULL and `= NULL` never
matches. This API has no principal at all (AD-03, "No auth yet, auth-ready"), no other mapper carries
one, and threading a permanently-null parameter from a controller through a service into every
statement would be a fourth spelling of "not yet". The column stays on the table, the unique index
over `COALESCE(owner_id, '')` still holds, and `Tag` does not carry the field either.

### 8. The history projection carries all twenty columns

`study_answers` has 20 columns and the plan's projection listed 19, dropping `comparison_version` —
under a Drift comment about exactly that: *"a column dropped from a projection is a fact that
silently stops being displayed"* (BR-242), which is why Drift uses `SELECT *` there. A test asserts
all twenty survive the read.

### 9. `nextSiblingPosition` counts tombstones

Drift filters `delete_batch_id IS NULL`; the server must **not**, because
`uq_decks_sibling_scope_position` covers tombstoned rows too. A soft-deleted sibling keeps its
position and therefore keeps holding the slot, so `MAX + 1` over active rows alone would hand a new
deck a slot a tombstone already owns.

The same fact answers a question the plan raised and got backwards: a restored deck's old position
**cannot** have been taken by a sibling created after the delete. It still takes a fresh slot, but
because a restore is a move (divergence 2) and a move always takes one.

### 10. Restore executes the move rather than re-checking it

BR-261: a restored sub-deck's target MUST satisfy **exactly** the move's rules, and *"MUST NOT có bộ
luật thứ hai dành riêng cho restore"*. So restore clears the batch's tombstones and then calls
`DeckMoveService.move` / `CardBulkService.move` on rows that are active again. The rules are
executed, not re-listed; a refusal rolls the transaction back and the rows return to being
tombstones. The refusals are the move's own error codes for the same reason.

### 11. The permanent purge enforces BR-266's no-mixing rule server-side

BR-266: *"Chọn nhiều trong Trash MUST tách theo loại item: một thao tác Restore hoặc Purge MUST NOT
trộn card và deck."* Its **Enforced by** column says `UI`, and the Flutter app holds it exactly
there — in `TrashSelectionState`, where a row of the wrong kind simply cannot be picked. Its
repository has no such check, because nothing can reach it with a mixed list.

An HTTP client has no selection state. At this boundary the rule is unenforced unless the endpoint
enforces it, so `POST /api/v1/trash/purge` refuses a mixed selection with
`PURGE_MIXES_ITEM_TYPES`. **This is an addition, not a port** — there is no Dart code it mirrors.

It has a consequence worth stating rather than discovering: a **deck** batch whose subtree still
holds an older **card** batch cannot be hand-purged at all. The blocker refuses it, and the one
selection that would clear the blocker names both kinds. It waits for retention, and the sweep takes
both once each has served its thirty days. The Flutter client reaches the same dead end for the same
reason; a test pins it.

### 12. The session close-write is one statement, not one per session

Drift closes each session with its own generated Companion update, looping over the id set. The port
issues a single `UPDATE … WHERE id IN (…)`. Same rows, same three columns, same transaction — one
round trip instead of N, and atomic per statement rather than per row.

## 7. Obligations, and how they were met

Both items this document listed as outstanding have since been implemented. They are kept here
rather than deleted because *why* they were outstanding is the part worth reading.

### BR-259 — session invalidation on delete · **done**

A soft-delete MUST close an in-progress session touching the deleted content, **in the same
transaction**, with `status = invalidated` and `end_reason = content_deleted`, and the reason MUST be
stored rather than inferred later. `trash.drift` says plainly why the write is not a Trash statement:

> Session invalidation (BR-259) is **not** here. The two lookups and the write live in
> `queries/study.drift`, because the session status × end_reason pair belongs to
> `StudySessionStatus.isValidWith` and Trash may not write it behind that enum's back.

So `com.memox.study` now exists as **exactly that sliver** — two lookups, one write, two enums — and
`TrashDeleteService` asks it for a verb. The verb owns both columns, which is what makes an illegal
pair unwritable rather than merely discouraged: nothing in the Postgres schema enforces pair
legality, because the column CHECKs are two independent lists rather than a compound one.

Three things about it are load-bearing and each has a test:

- **Two lookups, not one.** A session reviewing a whole root has its own `deck_id` set to the root,
  and the root is not in the batch when a sub-deck three levels down is deleted. Only its queue
  connects it. Drop the card-side lookup and that session keeps running over hidden material.
- **Before the marking.** The lookups take the id sets the deletion has already decided on, and
  those ids have to still describe live rows.
- **`in_progress` only.** A session that already ended stays as it ended (BR-86).

The queue's own `delete_batch_id IS NULL` guard at serve time is a backstop for this write failing,
not a substitute for it: BR-259 requires the session to be *closed and its reason stored*, not merely
to have its queue starved.

### BR-266 — the user-requested purge · **done**

`POST /api/v1/trash/purge`. Not the sweep with a different trigger: the same blocker signal means
opposite things to the two callers, which is why `countPurgeBlockers` takes its allowed set as a
parameter. The sweep **skips** a blocked batch; this **refuses**, and refuses whole — a confirmation
named an exact count before the call was made.

The existence check runs first and on its own, never folded into the blocker probe: purging "the
rest" would act on a set the user never saw. And the allowed set is exactly what was named, never
"everything past retention" — conflating the two would let one request quietly carry away unrelated
batches that happened to be old enough.

### 13. One count, two rules — and they now want different numbers

Making `tagCatalog.cardCount` mean *active* cards satisfies BR-230 and BR-237. It also changes what
a second rule reads off the same field, and that is worth stating plainly because it was found by
review rather than by any test.

BR-235: *"Xác nhận MUST nêu rõ **số thẻ sẽ bị gỡ tag**"* — the delete confirmation must say how many
cards will lose the tag. `tag_delete_confirm_widget.dart:57-59` takes that number from
`TagCatalogEntry.cardCount`. Deleting a tag removes **every** `card_tags` row for it — BR-235 says so
in the same sentence, and `card_tags.tag_id REFERENCES tags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` would do it
anyway. So a trashed card sharing the tag loses its link too, and is no longer in the number.

**Neither state of the code satisfies both rules.** Before, one number counted every link: BR-235 was
right and BR-230 was wrong. Now it counts active cards: BR-230 is right and BR-235 understates. The
conflation was always there; this change moved which side of it is broken — to the side a MUST about
the catalog explicitly names.

**Resolved by giving them two numbers.** `tagCatalog` gained a second aggregate,
`linkedCardCount`, counting every `card_tags` row; `TagCatalogEntry` carries both; and the delete
confirmation reads the new one. The catalog row still shows active cards, and the dialog still says
how many cards lose the tag. Both rules hold, and they hold with different numbers because they were
always asking different questions.

They can visibly disagree, and that is correct: a tag whose only remaining card is in Trash reads
`0` in the list and "1 card" in the dialog. It is genuinely not an unused tag — deleting it does take
something away — which is why the dialog's "unused" branch also switched to `linkedCardCount`.

The server keeps one number. `TagCatalogResponse` has no consumer that draws a delete confirmation,
and adding a field nothing reads is the surface this port has refused throughout (`allTags`,
`tagsForCards`, `purgeOrphans`). When a client needs it, the aggregate is one line.

**Not a defect, and not new:** that deleting a tag strips a trashed card's link at all. BR-235
requires it, the cascade enforces it, and it predates this change on both platforms. It does sit in
tension with BR-262's *"Id, nội dung, study state, history và tag MUST giữ nguyên"* for a card
restored after its tag was deleted — a card can come back without a tag it had. That tension is in
the rules, not in either implementation, and is recorded here for whoever reconciles them.

## 8. A documents finding, recorded rather than fixed

**BR-80 is stale against its own document.** It says `study_sessions.end_reason` MUST have **five**
values — `user_exit`, `scheduler_reset`, `stale_generation`, `persistence_error`, `interrupted`.
But BR-259, in the same file, requires `content_deleted`; BR-164 requires `scheduler_changed`; the
`V2` CHECK constraint allows all **seven**; and the Dart `StudySessionEndReason` enum defines all
seven. A port that took BR-80's list as the domain would reject the very value BR-259 demands.

`docs/business-rules.md` is **frozen for MVP**, and a feature task must not edit it — changing a rule
is a documents task. So this is recorded here and in `docs/wbs.md`, and
`com.memox.study.enums.StudySessionEndReason` carries all seven with a comment saying why it does not
match BR-80's prose.
