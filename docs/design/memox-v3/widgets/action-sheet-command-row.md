# ActionSheetCommandRow — design specification for Flutter handoff

HANDOFF MODE: COMPONENT
IMPLEMENTATION ACTION: IMPLEMENT_COMPONENT
  Build or extend a shared component for this contract.

Source: MemoX v3 HTML design kit · D · Surfaces, rows & content
NON-BINDING MATERIAL ANALOGY: an InkWell row inside a modal sheet
  Orientation only. Inspect the repository and map this contract onto what is
  already there — do not read the analogy as a widget tree to reproduce.

> Run the MemoX Foundations spec ONCE before this prompt. It carries the palette
> (both themes), the type scale, the spacing / radius / icon / elevation scales,
> the semantic alias layer, screen composition, responsive rules and the web
> techniques that must not be copied. Everything below assumes it and names
> tokens instead of repeating values.

## Implementation guardrails

Build or extend a shared component for this contract.

Before implementing: inspect the Flutter repository — its existing shared
widgets, theme and tokens. Reuse or extend whatever already owns this semantic
contract instead of adding a parallel one, map this contract onto the existing
theme / token architecture, and never re-declare a Foundations value locally
when a token or theme role already exists.

THIS COMPONENT OWNS: its visual geometry · internal spacing · content slots · variants · visual and interaction states · the minimum interactive target · its own long-content behaviour.

THE CALLER OWNS: screen placement · external spacing · navigation · business
rules · validation flow · feature state management. Do not pull a caller-owned
concern in because the HTML mock colocates them.

Source-design identifiers (CSS class names, JSX component names) appear below
for traceability only. They are NOT Flutter API names and a CSS class is not a
variant enum — expose the smallest semantic API this contract needs. Global
palette / type / spacing / composition work belongs to the Foundations run.

## Component visual intent — ActionSheetCommandRow

One command inside a bottom-sheet action list — six character-identical copies across the library and card features. Deliberately NOT SettingsRow (36 tile, 16 label, 40 lead column) and NOT ListRow (a content row, 28 tile): the same silhouette, a different contract.

## Component contract — ActionSheetCommandRow

Dimensions — label, dimension class, value:
  grid                FIXED           32 lead · 1fr label · auto trailing
  gap                 FIXED           12 between columns
  padding             FIXED           12 vertical · 8 horizontal — the sheet supplies the outer gutter
  tile                FIXED           30 · COMPONENT, radius 8 (--memox-radius-sm)
  label               FIXED           14/600/-0.1px
  sub                 FIXED           12, one optional line
  row height          CONTENT-DRIVEN  label + optional sub set it
  tap area            MINIMUM         48

FIXED means reproduce the value. MINIMUM means never go below it, grow freely.
MAXIMUM means never exceed it. CONTENT-DRIVEN means the content sets it — do
not convert it into a fixed box, and a content-driven control entering a
loading state keeps the width that instance already had. RESPONSIVE means it
changes with width or text scale. SYSTEM-OWNED means the platform supplies it.
UNSPECIFIED means this design does not determine the value: do not invent one —
keep the repository's existing convention where that is safe, and ask when
geometry, state behaviour, interaction, content loss or accessibility cannot be
settled without an answer.

Where a painted dimension is smaller than the 48 touch minimum, both numbers
are in the table and both hold: keep the painted geometry and meet the touch
area by whatever platform technique the repo prefers — do not inflate the
control.

## Foundation token references — ActionSheetCommandRow

Resolve each of these against the Foundations spec; none of them is redefined
here:

  danger-soft · onSurface · radius-sm

## Theme consumption — ActionSheetCommandRow

The common Flutter theme must ALREADY have been established by the theme
prerequisite handoff before this component is implemented. The bindings below
are semantic dependencies, consumed through the repository's canonical theme
implementation — do not hard-code the V3 hex values locally, do not copy a
standard ColorScheme role into this widget, do not redefine a MemoX semantic
role here, and do not re-resolve a role the theme step already resolved.

Do not reopen or rebuild the global theme in this task. If a role below is
missing from the existing theme, REPORT THE THEME GAP — a missing role is a
prerequisite defect, not permission to patch a colour into this component.

GENERATED VIEW from this component's themeRoleUsage records. Three access
modes, three shapes:

  DIRECT           this component reads the theme role itself
  VIA_COMPONENT    it composes another shared component and selects that
                   child's semantic configuration — the CHILD owns every
                   colour behind it. No role is named here, and you must not
                   recolour the child from this side
  COMPONENT_INPUT  the value arrives per instance from the caller; it is not a
                   theme field

  slot / state                      binding
  tile fill · default               primary  ·  M3_COLOR
      access: DIRECT · treatment: TINT 8%
      a COMPONENT tint of primary at 8%
  tile fill · danger                danger-soft  ·  DERIVED_COLOR
      access: DIRECT · treatment: FULL_STRENGTH
      the destructive command tile
  tile glyph · default              primary  ·  M3_COLOR
      access: DIRECT · treatment: FULL_STRENGTH
      the command glyph
  tile glyph · danger               error  ·  M3_COLOR
      access: DIRECT · treatment: FULL_STRENGTH
      the destructive command glyph
  label · default                   onSurface  ·  M3_COLOR
      access: DIRECT · treatment: FULL_STRENGTH
      the command verb
  label · danger                    error  ·  M3_COLOR
      access: DIRECT · treatment: FULL_STRENGTH
      the destructive verb — named in colour AND in words
  sub                               onSurfaceVariant  ·  M3_COLOR
      access: DIRECT · treatment: FULL_STRENGTH
      the qualifier line
  chevron                           onSurfaceVariant  ·  M3_COLOR
      access: DIRECT · treatment: FULL_STRENGTH
      present when the command opens a further surface
  focus ring · focused              primary  ·  M3_COLOR
      access: DIRECT · treatment: BORDER
      global focus treatment

## Icons / content slots — ActionSheetCommandRow

Glyph names this component paints, verbatim from the kit:

  eye
  pencil
  flag
  folder-tree
  trash-2
  play
  download
  upload
  tag
  chevron-right

These are LUCIDE names. The kit uses Lucide as a stand-in because the HTML
preview has no Material Symbols dependency; the app ships Material Symbols.
Do not treat the string as an Icons.* identifier — pick the nearest Material
Symbol by MEANING, and keep the meaning stable across every screen that uses
it (one concept, one glyph). Where the glyph arrives as a slot, the name above
is what the kit demonstrates, not a fixed part of the contract; the size step
in the dimension table IS fixed.

## State matrix — ActionSheetCommandRow

  default           primary-tinted tile, onSurface label, optional sub, trailing chevron
  danger            danger-soft tile, error glyph and label — same geometry
  no sub            single-line row; the tile stays 30 and the row shortens
  terminal          no chevron — the command acts instead of opening a surface
  pressed           platform ripple across the row [INFERRED]
  focused           2px primary ring, offset 2

Entries marked [INFERRED] are not drawn in the mock. Implement one only where
it matches the repository's existing design-system convention; otherwise keep
the canonical Flutter behaviour and report the mismatch. Never invent a new
convention to satisfy an inferred mock behaviour.

## Long-content behaviour — ActionSheetCommandRow

  label + sub
      commands are short product verbs; the label stays one line and the sub carries the qualifier ("Recoverable for 30 days"). A command needing two lines of label is the wrong command.

## Caller-owned — do NOT build into ActionSheetCommandRow

  · the command list, the divider grouping between commands, and the destructive intent — passed as a tone, never decided here

## Priorities — ActionSheetCommandRow

  P1  the dimension table and the tones/variants above — the component's own
      surface treatment, geometry and type
  P2  its states, icon steps and hairline / shadow treatment
  P3  motion and decorative polish
  Global palette, type scale and spacing rhythm are the FOUNDATIONS run's
  priorities, not this task's.

## Self-check — ActionSheetCommandRow

  mode boundary           PASS
  dimension classes       PASS
  token references        PASS
  ownership               PASS
  web mechanics           PASS
  touch geometry          PASS
  long content            PASS
  loading width           n/a
  UNSPECIFIED             none
  internal contradiction  PASS

## Implementation handoff — ActionSheetCommandRow

COMPONENT CONTRACT:
  ActionSheetCommandRow — the dimension table, long-content rules and state matrix above. The dimension
  CLASSIFICATIONS are binding; the source CSS class names are not.
  glyphs (Lucide names, map by meaning to Material Symbols): eye · pencil · flag · folder-tree · trash-2 · play · download · upload · tag · chevron-right

IMPLEMENTATION ACTION:
  IMPLEMENT_COMPONENT — Build or extend a shared component for this contract.

THEME ROLES CONSUMED DIRECTLY — READ, DO NOT REDEFINE:
primary · danger-soft · error · onSurface · onSurfaceVariant


THEME GAPS TO REPORT UPSTREAM:
  none — every role above is established by the theme prerequisite

CALLER-OWNED — DO NOT ABSORB:
  · the command list, the divider grouping between commands, and the destructive intent — passed as a tone, never decided here

Everything else (tokens, colour, type, spacing, composition, responsive rules)
comes from the Foundations spec — do not re-derive it from this prompt.

SYSTEM-OWNED — DO NOT IMPLEMENT AS APP UI:
  status bar (44 in the preview) · cutout · gesture/nav inset · keyboard
  inset · system Back · the device bezel

DO NOT COPY LITERALLY FROM HTML/JSX:
  absolute positioning · ::after hit expanders · backdrop-filter · color-mix
  overlays · hover states · fake system chrome · fixed pixel boxes around text
