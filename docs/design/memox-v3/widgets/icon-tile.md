# IconTile — design specification for Flutter handoff

HANDOFF MODE: COMPONENT
IMPLEMENTATION ACTION: IMPLEMENT_COMPONENT
  Build or extend a shared component for this contract.

Source: MemoX v3 HTML design kit · D · Surfaces, rows & content
NON-BINDING MATERIAL ANALOGY: a tinted square holding a glyph
  Orientation only. Inspect the repository and map this contract onto what is
  already there — do not read the analogy as a widget tree to reproduce.

> Run the MemoX Foundations spec ONCE before this prompt. It carries the palette
> (both themes), the type scale, the spacing / radius / icon / elevation scales,
> the semantic alias layer, screen composition, responsive rules and the web
> techniques that must not be copied. Everything below assumes it and names
> tokens instead of repeating values.

## Implementation guardrails

Build or extend a shared component for this contract.

Before implementing: inspect the Flutter repository — its existing shared
widgets, theme and tokens. Reuse or extend whatever already owns this semantic
contract instead of adding a parallel one, map this contract onto the existing
theme / token architecture, and never re-declare a Foundations value locally
when a token or theme role already exists.

THIS COMPONENT OWNS: its visual geometry · internal spacing · content slots · variants · its own long-content behaviour. It is a surface, not a control: it has no interaction states or touch target of its own.

THE CALLER OWNS: screen placement · external spacing · navigation · business
rules · validation flow · feature state management. Do not pull a caller-owned
concern in because the HTML mock colocates them.

Source-design identifiers (CSS class names, JSX component names) appear below
for traceability only. They are NOT Flutter API names and a CSS class is not a
variant enum — expose the smallest semantic API this contract needs. Global
palette / type / spacing / composition work belongs to the Foundations run.

## Component visual intent — IconTile

The tinted square that leads a row. Three sizes, each with a role: 28 in content rows, 36 in settings and action-sheet commands, 44 in deck rows. `seed` swaps the primary tint for a per-deck colour.

## Component contract — IconTile

Dimensions — label, dimension class, value:
  sm                  FIXED           28 box · radius 8 · glyph 16 — content rows, move targets
  md                  FIXED           36 box · radius 12 · glyph 20 — settings rows, sheet commands
  lg                  FIXED           44 box · radius 12 · glyph 20 — deck rows at every depth
  default tint        FIXED           primary @10% light · @16% dark, primary glyph
  seeded tint         CONTENT-DRIVEN  seed colour @12%, seed glyph
  shrink              FIXED           never — the text column beside it gives up space first

FIXED means reproduce the value. MINIMUM means never go below it, grow freely.
MAXIMUM means never exceed it. CONTENT-DRIVEN means the content sets it — do
not convert it into a fixed box, and a content-driven control entering a
loading state keeps the width that instance already had. RESPONSIVE means it
changes with width or text scale. SYSTEM-OWNED means the platform supplies it.
UNSPECIFIED means this design does not determine the value: do not invent one —
keep the repository's existing convention where that is safe, and ask when
geometry, state behaviour, interaction, content loss or accessibility cannot be
settled without an answer.

Where a painted dimension is smaller than the 48 touch minimum, both numbers
are in the table and both hold: keep the painted geometry and meet the touch
area by whatever platform technique the repo prefers — do not inflate the
control.

## Theme consumption — IconTile

The common Flutter theme must ALREADY have been established by the theme
prerequisite handoff before this component is implemented. The bindings below
are semantic dependencies, consumed through the repository's canonical theme
implementation — do not hard-code the V3 hex values locally, do not copy a
standard ColorScheme role into this widget, do not redefine a MemoX semantic
role here, and do not re-resolve a role the theme step already resolved.

Do not reopen or rebuild the global theme in this task. If a role below is
missing from the existing theme, REPORT THE THEME GAP — a missing role is a
prerequisite defect, not permission to patch a colour into this component.

GENERATED VIEW from this component's themeRoleUsage records. Three access
modes, three shapes:

  DIRECT           this component reads the theme role itself
  VIA_COMPONENT    it composes another shared component and selects that
                   child's semantic configuration — the CHILD owns every
                   colour behind it. No role is named here, and you must not
                   recolour the child from this side
  COMPONENT_INPUT  the value arrives per instance from the caller; it is not a
                   theme field

  slot / state                      binding
  tile · default                    primary  ·  M3_COLOR
      access: DIRECT · treatment: TINT 10% light / 16% dark
      the tinted square behind the glyph — a COMPONENT tint of primary, not the primary-soft token (authored at 10/20)
  glyph · default                   primary  ·  M3_COLOR
      access: DIRECT · treatment: FULL_STRENGTH
      centred in the tile
  tile · seeded                     seed  ·  instance input
      access: COMPONENT_INPUT · treatment: TINT 12%
      a per-deck colour the caller passes
  glyph · seeded                    seed  ·  instance input
      access: COMPONENT_INPUT · treatment: FULL_STRENGTH
      the same caller colour for the glyph

## Icons / content slots — IconTile

Glyph names this component paints, verbatim from the kit:

  layers
  file-text
  tag
  folder
  trash-2

These are LUCIDE names. The kit uses Lucide as a stand-in because the HTML
preview has no Material Symbols dependency; the app ships Material Symbols.
Do not treat the string as an Icons.* identifier — pick the nearest Material
Symbol by MEANING, and keep the meaning stable across every screen that uses
it (one concept, one glyph). Where the glyph arrives as a slot, the name above
is what the kit demonstrates, not a fixed part of the contract; the size step
in the dimension table IS fixed.

## State matrix — IconTile

  resting           tinted square, centred glyph
  custom child      any node may replace the glyph (a letter, a count, a donut)

Entries marked [INFERRED] are not drawn in the mock. Implement one only where
it matches the repository's existing design-system convention; otherwise keep
the canonical Flutter behaviour and report the mismatch. Never invent a new
convention to satisfy an inferred mock behaviour.

## Caller-owned — do NOT build into IconTile

  · the seed colour, which ListRow forwards unchanged — IconTile owns the tint and glyph treatment, the row never paints a seed itself

## Source trace — non-binding

  --memox-primary-soft (primary @10% light / @20% dark)declared in Foundations but has NO v3 call site: the shipped tile tints primary itself at 10/16, so the contract binds primary with an explicit treatment rather than claiming a token whose dark value differs

## Priorities — IconTile

  P1  the dimension table and the tones/variants above — the component's own
      surface treatment, geometry and type
  P2  its states, icon steps and hairline / shadow treatment
  P3  motion and decorative polish
  Global palette, type scale and spacing rhythm are the FOUNDATIONS run's
  priorities, not this task's.

## Implementation handoff — IconTile

COMPONENT CONTRACT:
  IconTile — the dimension table and state matrix above. The dimension
  CLASSIFICATIONS are binding; the source CSS class names are not.
  glyphs (Lucide names, map by meaning to Material Symbols): layers · file-text · tag · folder · trash-2

IMPLEMENTATION ACTION:
  IMPLEMENT_COMPONENT — Build or extend a shared component for this contract.

THEME ROLES CONSUMED DIRECTLY — READ, DO NOT REDEFINE:
primary
INSTANCE INPUTS — NOT THEME FIELDS:
  · seed


THEME GAPS TO REPORT UPSTREAM:
  none — every role above is established by the theme prerequisite

CALLER-OWNED — DO NOT ABSORB:
  · the seed colour, which ListRow forwards unchanged — IconTile owns the tint and glyph treatment, the row never paints a seed itself

Everything else (tokens, colour, type, spacing, composition, responsive rules)
comes from the Foundations spec — do not re-derive it from this prompt.

SYSTEM-OWNED — DO NOT IMPLEMENT AS APP UI:
  status bar (44 in the preview) · cutout · gesture/nav inset · keyboard
  inset · system Back · the device bezel

DO NOT COPY LITERALLY FROM HTML/JSX:
  absolute positioning · ::after hit expanders · backdrop-filter · color-mix
  overlays · hover states · fake system chrome · fixed pixel boxes around text
