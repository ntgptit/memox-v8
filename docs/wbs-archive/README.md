# WBS archive

Closed WBS entries, moved out of `../wbs.md` on 2026-09-08 (M100.65) so the
living ledger holds only living work. **Nothing here was edited on the way
out** — each entry is byte-identical to the one that left. `m100.md` carries
two later exceptions, recorded at its own top: a same-branch id collision with
`origin/main` renumbered one entry (`M100.62` → `M100.66`), and `main`'s own
`M100.62` merged in verbatim alongside it.

These files are still policed. `check_docs.py`'s `_wbs_ledgers()` globs this
directory, so a retired id cannot be reused and a live task may depend on one
that closed. They are deliberately outside `_docs_md()`, so they carry no
7-field header and claim no source of truth: a retired entry is a record, not
a contract.

| File | Milestone | Entries | Lines |
|---|---|---|---|
| `t0-t1-m2-m3.md` | harness, project foundation, architecture foundation | 29 | 1,351 |
| `m4.md` | router and Drift foundation, deck and card slices | 83 | 4,844 |
| `m5.md` | study vertical slice — UC-05 | 28 | 1,556 |
| `m99.md` | adhoc feature and hardening work | 96 | 7,023 |
| `m100.md` | design-system reconciliation and screen consistency | 65 | 4,869 |

**Where to look for what.** A task id tells you the file: `M4.10ap` is in
`m4.md`, `M99.62` in `m99.md`. To find every mention of a task across both the
ledger and the archive:

```bash
grep -rn "M99\.62" docs/wbs.md docs/wbs-archive/
```

## What is still checked, and what is not

`check_docs.py` treats these five files as part of the same task-id space as
`../wbs.md`: the **duplicate-id scan**, the **dependency graph** (a live task
may depend on an archived one, and the edge must resolve), and the
**section-level check** (a task heading written at `##` instead of `###` is
invisible to both) all run over every file `_wbs_ledgers()` returns, archive
included.

Seven checks do **not** reach this directory. `_check_m_task_template` — the
one that requires every `M`-level entry to carry Status, Goal, Scope, Editable
documents, Output, Acceptance criteria, Dependencies, Tests required and
Checklist phases, with a non-empty acceptance-criteria block — reads
`docs/wbs.md` alone, by design: a closed entry is an immutable record of what
happened, not a live contract that still has to satisfy an evolving template,
and re-validating 299 already-closed entries on every CI run would buy
nothing. The other six miss this directory for a different reason, not by
design: `_check_markers`, `_check_duplicate_headings`,
`_check_superseded_rows`, `_check_duplicate_table_ids`,
`_check_banned_coalesce` and `_check_deck_flow_drift` all read `_docs_md()`,
whose globs are `docs/*.md`, `docs/it-scenarios/*.md` and
`docs/design-system/*.md` — none of which reach `docs/wbs-archive/`.

The gap is real. It is also, as of this writing, empty: all seven checks were
run by hand against every archived entry and found nothing to flag — no
missing template field, no unresolved marker, no duplicate heading, no
uncleared superseded row, no duplicate table id, no banned `COALESCE` pattern,
no stale deck-flow claim. If a future archived entry ever fails one of these
seven, `check_docs.py` will not catch it; only the three checks named above
still cover the archive.
