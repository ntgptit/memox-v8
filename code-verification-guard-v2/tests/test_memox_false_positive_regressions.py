"""Regression tests for false-positive fixes that live only in this vendored copy.

Two rule fixes were made here in response to real MemoX false positives, and
because this guard is now owned as a vendored copy of MemoX (see AGENTS.md), they
have to be pinned by tests so a future edit — or a careless re-vendor — cannot
silently bring the false positives back:

  1. ``common.no_commented_out_code`` used to flag any prose comment that began
     with a keyword like ``for`` or ``return``. It now requires the *syntax* that
     follows the keyword in real code, so a wrapped explanatory comment is left
     alone while genuine commented-out code is still caught.

  2. ``memox.testing.no_real_clock_in_test`` used to match ``DateTime.now()``
     wherever it appeared, including inside a comment that merely named it. It is
     now anchored so it only fires on a call reached without passing a ``//``.

Each test asserts both directions: the benign case produces no violation, and the
real defect still does. Loading the rule from the registry YAML — rather than
re-declaring the pattern — is what makes this a regression test for the fix
itself, not for a copy of it.
