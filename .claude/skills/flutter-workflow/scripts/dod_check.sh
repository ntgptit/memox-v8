# Usage: .claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/dod_check.sh
#        [--changed [--base <git-ref>]] [--fast] [--fix] [--force]
#   --changed  build the same feature × layer × risk plan as PR CI from the
#              diff against --base (default: origin/main), then run only the
#              selected host tests and Widgetbook surface. Unknown/high-risk
#              paths promote themselves to the full non-golden host suite.
#   --base     comparison ref for --changed; invalid without --changed
#   --fast  the tight-loop mode: run only the Deck + app test subset (what CI's
#           light gate runs), skipping goldens. ~20s instead of ~50s. It does
#           NOT run test/core, test/shared, or another feature's tests — run the
#           full gate (no --fast) before you commit, and always before a merge.
#   --fix   apply `dart format` instead of only reporting drift
#   --force ignore the pass stamp and run even if this exact tree already passed
#
# **The pass stamp, and why it exists.** Running this twice on an unchanged tree
# is not caution, it is the same answer bought twice — and it happens on every
# change, because "before commit", "before push" and "before the PR" feel like
# three moments and are one state. A successful run now records a fingerprint of
# the tree it verified; a later run with the same fingerprint prints what it
# already knows and exits in ~0.4s instead of 50-150s.
#
# A `full` pass satisfies `--changed` and `--fast`, because it is a superset of
# both. The reverse never holds.
#
# The fingerprint covers HEAD, every tracked modification, and every untracked
# file git would not ignore — so `.fvmrc` and `pubspec.lock` are inside it. What
# it cannot see is the Flutter SDK being swapped underneath a `.fvmrc` that did
# not change. That is a deliberate hole: closing it costs `flutter --version` on
# every invocation, which is most of what the stamp saves, and swapping an SDK
# is rare and deliberate. `--force` is the way out.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Where the time goes, measured rather than assumed (2026-08-29, this machine,
# warm — the numbers in brackets are the first run in a fresh worktree, where
# touching thousands of files for the first time costs an order of magnitude
# more and every gate pays it at once):
#
#   flutter test    43s          dart format          3s
#   flutter analyze 10s          check_docs.py        2s   [28s]
#   guard (python)  11s          CI tooling tests     8s
#                                architecture guard   2s
#
# **This file is not the bottleneck and rewriting it in another language does
# not help.** It has no per-file loop and no fork storm — the thing that made
# `check_architecture.sh` take two minutes before it became Python. It starts
# seven subprocesses and prints a summary; the cost is inside those seven.
#
# The CI tooling gate was **43s** until 2026-08-29 and the table above did not
# mention it at all, so nothing pointed at the second-largest cost in the run.
# It was not the tests being slow: 32 of them called `build_plan` against this
# repository, and each call re-read every tracked Dart file to weigh the tests
# and build the import graph. That scan is memoized per root now — see
# `build_verification_plan.py`. Keep this table honest when a gate moves; a
# stale one is how a gate grows into the bottleneck without anyone noticing.
#
# Two things in here *were* worth fixing, and both are scheduling rather than
# language:
#
#   1. It shelled into `bash check_*.sh`, and each of those wrappers only
#      `exec`s a `.py`. On Windows git-bash that fork measured **286ms**, three
#      times over — nearly a second spent starting shells that immediately
#      replace themselves. The `.py` is called directly now; the `.sh` wrappers
#      stay for everyone else who calls them by name.
#   2. Every gate ran in series although only one pair has an ordering
#      constraint. They run concurrently now, with each step's output buffered
#      and replayed in a fixed order — parallel execution, serial reading, so a
#      failure is still findable.
