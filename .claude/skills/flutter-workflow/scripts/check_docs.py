"""Specification integrity checker.

The docs in docs/ are a contract that code is written against, and the failure
mode that matters is a reference that points at the wrong thing — BR-13 citing
"BR-36" for reset after a renumber moved reset to BR-44. Nothing catches that at
runtime; it surfaces only when a human reads it and complies.

**Why Python and not the bash it replaced.** The checks are unchanged. The bash
version ran dozens of `awk`, `grep` and `find` forks and a per-file `grep` loop
in section D — on Windows git-bash each fork costs tens of milliseconds and the
whole thing took 134 seconds. This reads every document once, in one process.
The `.sh` beside it is a thin wrapper so every caller and every doc that names
it keeps working. C1/C2 still delegate to `verify_invariants.py` unchanged.

Usage: check_docs.py [--db <path-to-sqlite-db>] [--quiet]
Exit:  0 clean, 1 problems found.
