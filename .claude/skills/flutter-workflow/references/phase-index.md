## Why the grouping looks like this

Phases were grouped by *when you actually think about them together*, not by
their number:

- **6 (bootstrap/flavors/errors) sits with 2–3, not on its own.** Bootstrap,
  flavors and the error model are all decisions you make once while standing the
  project up, and they constrain each other — the flavor determines the log level
  that the bootstrap installs, and the error model determines what the error
  boundary reports.
- **12 (localization) and 13 (a11y) sit with 7 (design system).** Both are
  properties of how components are written. A component built without a semantic
  label or with a hardcoded string has to be reopened later; folding these into
  the design-system skill makes them part of building a component rather than a
  retrofit pass.
- **16–22 are one skill.** They share a trigger — the project is heading toward
  release — and in practice you touch several of them in the same session.
- **14 stays alone** because it is the loop you run dozens of times, and it
  composes the other skills rather than duplicating them.
