description: Entry point and router for all development work on this Flutter app. Use this skill whenever work starts on memox-v7 and the next step is not already obvious — "what's next", "start phase N", "let's build X", "continue the app", "add a feature", "is this done", "review before commit" — and whenever you need to know which of the other flutter-* skills applies. It maps the 22-phase checklist in docs/checklist.md to the specific skill that covers each phase, enforces the dependency order between phases, and holds the Definition of Done. Consult it before starting any non-trivial task so work does not begin on a phase whose prerequisites are still open.

# Flutter workflow router

This project is built against a 22-phase checklist (`docs/checklist.md`). This
skill decides *what to work on next* and *which skill to load*. It does not
contain implementation detail — that lives in the specialised skills.

## First: find out where the project actually is

Do not trust memory or assumption about project state. Check:

```bash
cat docs/wbs.md 2>/dev/null | head -60   # the progress ledger
ls lib/ 2>/dev/null                      # does the app exist yet
git log --oneline -10
```

`docs/wbs.md` is authoritative for progress. If it is missing or clearly stale
relative to the code, say so and fix it before building anything else — every
later decision depends on it being true.

## Routing table

| You are doing | Load skill | Checklist phase |
|---|---|---|
| Defining the product, users, MVP scope, use cases, business rules, WBS, docs | `flutter-product-spec` | 0, 1 |
| Creating the Flutter project, dependencies, flavors, bootstrap, error model | `flutter-project-setup` | 2, 3, 6 |
| Folder structure, layer boundaries, lint config, naming, code conventions | `flutter-architecture` | 4, 5 |
| Design tokens, theming, shared components, responsive, localization, a11y | `flutter-design-system` | 7, 12, 13 |
| A component theme in `lib/core/theme/`, an `Mx*` widget's API, admitting a new Material widget, theme ↔ widget parity | `flutter-theme-design` | 7 (component level) |
| Routes, guards, deep links, nested shells, back behaviour | `flutter-navigation` | 8 |
| Providers, controllers, UI state modelling, side effects | `flutter-state-riverpod` | 9 |
| Dio, API contracts, repository shape, DTO/entity split, cache, sync, secure storage | `flutter-data-layer` | 10, 11 |
| Anything under `lib/core/database/` or a `data/` folder — `.drift` schema and queries, indexes, migrations, DAOs, transactions, stream invalidation — and reviewing a database PR | `flutter-drift` | 11 |
| Building one feature end to end | `flutter-feature-slice` | 14 |
| Any kind of test | `flutter-testing` | 15 |
| Security, performance, logging, analytics, CI/CD, release, post-release | `flutter-ship` | 16–22 |

When a task spans several rows — which most real tasks do — `flutter-feature-slice`
is usually the right entry point; it pulls in the others in the right order.

**Before building a feature, read the two that already went the whole way.** Deck
and Card are the worked examples:
`flutter-feature-slice/assets/feature_blueprint.md` records what they settled,
`lib/features/deck/README.md` and `lib/features/card/README.md` record each
slice. Take the **method** from them — layering, where a rule is enforced, what a
use case may know, which test sits at which level — and not the business. Neither
feature's data shape is a template (AD-17); a third feature that grows a tree or
a `content_type` because Deck has one has copied the wrong half.

This routing line exists because it was missing: until M99.2 the front door named
no reference implementation at all, so an agent found the blueprint only by
landing on `flutter-feature-slice` first.

## Phase order is a dependency graph, not a suggestion

The recommended order is:

```
business requirements → use cases + business rules → WBS → project foundation
→ architecture boundaries → theme & tokens → minimal shared components → router
→ database/network foundation → features as vertical slices → automated tests
→ pixel comparison → CI/CD → internal testing → production release → monitoring
```

The expensive mistakes this ordering prevents are specific, and worth naming so
you can recognise when someone is about to make one:

- **UI before business rules are settled.** The screens get built around an
  assumption, the rule lands differently, and the state model has to be redone.
  If the rules for a flow are still open, build something else.
- **Features before tokens and the router.** Every feature then hardcodes colours
  and navigation, and you pay to unpick it in every file.
- **Shared components before two real callers exist.** A component abstracted from
  one usage is a guess. Wait for the second caller — it tells you what actually
  varies. Two similar-looking widgets is not a reason to merge them.
- **Tests deferred to "after the feature works".** They then get written against
  whatever the code happens to do, which is not the same as what it should do.

If asked to jump ahead, do not silently refuse and do not silently comply. Say
which prerequisite is open, what the concrete risk is, and offer the smallest
unblocking step. If the user confirms after hearing that, proceed — it is their
call, and a documented deliberate shortcut is fine. Note it in the WBS.

## Definition of Done

Read `references/definition-of-done.md` before marking anything complete. The
mechanical half is automated:

```bash
.claude/skills/flutter-workflow/scripts/dod_check.sh
```

That runs the full mechanical gate — codegen freshness, format, analyze, tests, the architecture boundary check, the code-verification guard and the docs guard (see the script header for the exact list). It cannot
judge whether the acceptance criteria are met, whether the UI matches the design,
or whether the WBS entry is honest — that part is on you, and it is the half
that actually catches problems.

## Keeping the ledger honest

Update `docs/wbs.md` in the same commit as the work it describes. Mark items
done only when they are done by the Definition of Done, not when the code first
runs. If something was descoped or deferred, write that down with the reason —
a future session reading "done" on a half-finished item will build on sand.

`references/phase-index.md` has the full phase-to-skill map with the specific
checklist sub-sections each skill covers, for when the table above is too coarse.
