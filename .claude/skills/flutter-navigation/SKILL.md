# Navigation

Covers checklist Phase 8. Router configuration lives in `app/router/`.

```
app/router/
├── app_router.dart      # GoRouter instance, redirect logic
├── route_paths.dart     # path + name constants
└── route_guards.dart    # (not yet — auth is deferred, AD-03; add with the auth phase)
```

## Routes are declared centrally, referenced by name

No widget contains a path string. Paths live in one place; screens navigate by
name so a path change is a one-line edit rather than a grep-and-pray.

```dart
abstract final class RoutePaths {
  static const splash = '/';
  static const login = '/login';
  static const decks = '/decks';
  static const deckDetail = '/decks/:deckId';   // pattern
  static const settings = '/settings';
}

abstract final class RouteNames {
  static const splash = 'splash';
  static const login = 'login';
  static const decks = 'decks';
  static const deckDetail = 'deckDetail';
  static const settings = 'settings';
}
```

```dart
context.goNamed(RouteNames.deckDetail, pathParameters: {'deckId': id});  // yes
context.go('/decks/$id');                                                // no
```

`go_router_builder` typed routes are worth adopting if the route table grows —
they make parameter mistakes compile errors instead of runtime 404s. Either
approach satisfies the checklist; the thing that does not is a raw string in a
widget.

## Pass IDs, not objects

Route extras are not part of the URL, so anything passed that way is absent on
a cold-start deep link and lost on state restoration. A screen that receives a
`Deck` object works when reached by tapping and shows a blank page when reached
from a notification.

Pass the ID, load from the repository on the target screen. The list already
cached the data, so the load is usually instant anyway. Use `extra` only for
things that genuinely cannot be re-derived and only matter in-session.

## Shell routes and bottom navigation

`StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack` gives each tab its own `Navigator` and
preserves its stack across tab switches — which is what users expect: switching
away and back should not reset a scroll position or pop a detail screen.

Nest detail routes *inside* the branch that owns them so the tab bar stays
visible and the branch's back stack is correct.

## Guards

> **Deferred until auth lands (AD-03).** This section is reference material for
> that phase — do not build an auth guard, login flow or `authStateProvider` now.

Put auth redirection in the router's `redirect`, not in screen `initState`. A
guard in `initState` means the protected screen is built and briefly visible
before the redirect fires, and every new screen has to remember to add it.

```dart
redirect: (context, state) {
  final isSignedIn = ref.read(authStateProvider).isSignedIn;
  final isOnAuthRoute = state.matchedLocation == RoutePaths.login;

  if (!isSignedIn && !isOnAuthRoute) {
    // Preserve where they were headed so login can return them there.
    return Uri(
      path: RoutePaths.login,
      queryParameters: {'from': state.matchedLocation},
    ).toString();
  }
  if (isSignedIn && isOnAuthRoute) return RoutePaths.decks;
  return null;   // null means "no redirect", not "block"
}
```

Two things this must get right or it will loop forever: the guard must exempt
the route it redirects *to*, and it must return `null` (not the current path)
when no redirect is needed.

Rebuild the router on auth change with `refreshListenable`, driven from the auth
provider. Without it, signing out leaves the user sitting on a protected screen
until they navigate.

**A redirect fires on forward navigation only — never on pop.** If a route
redirects onward when opened (deck detail → card list when the deck holds
cards), backing out of the target lands on the *redirect source*, which the
user never saw on the way in. Found the hard way as IT-TREE-003: back from a
card list dropped onto the intermediate deck level. There are two honest
responses, and the project chose per-site: `push` the target instead of `go`
where the source screen is a real place the user should return through
(`deck_list_screen.dart` does this), or accept the extra back-tap and record
it — never assume the redirect will "undo" itself on the way back, and never
compensate inside the screen's `build`. Any new redirect-onward route must
state which of the two it picked and cover it with a router test.

## 404 and errors

Set `errorBuilder` to a real screen with a route back to a known-good location.
The default red error page is a dead end for the user and leaks framework
detail.

## Deep links

A deep link must work on cold start, which is the case that breaks: the app
launches, the router evaluates the redirect before auth state has loaded, and
the user lands on login instead of the deep-linked screen.

Handle it by having the splash route hold until auth resolves, and by preserving
the intended destination through the login flow (the `from` parameter above).

Test each supported link cold (app not running), warm (backgrounded), and while
already on the target screen.

## Back behaviour

Android's system back and iOS's edge swipe must both do the sensible thing.

- Never push a duplicate of the current route — repeated taps on a list item
  while the push animates is the usual cause. Guard with a debounce or check
  the current location.
- Dialogs and bottom sheets participate in the back stack. Dismissing one should
  not exit the screen behind it.
- Use `PopScope` for unsaved-changes confirmation, and make sure the callback
  handles a declined pop correctly rather than popping anyway.
- After `await`ing a navigation result, check `context.mounted` before using
  the context — the analyzer's `use_build_context_synchronously` rule catches
  most of these but not all.

## Checks before navigation is done

- [ ] No path string outside `route_paths.dart`.
- [ ] Every route reachable by name.
- [ ] Auth guard covers all protected routes and cannot loop.
- [ ] 404 screen offers a way back.
- [ ] Each deep link tested cold, warm, and while already open.
- [ ] Tab state survives tab switching.
- [ ] Back works on Android and iOS, including from dialogs and sheets.
- [ ] No route receives a domain object where an ID would do.
