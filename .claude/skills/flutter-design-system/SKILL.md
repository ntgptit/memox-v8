# Design system, localization and accessibility

Covers checklist Phases 7 (tokens, theme, components, responsive), 12
(localization) and 13 (accessibility).

These three are one skill because they are all properties of *how a component is
written*. A component built with a hardcoded colour, a literal string, or no
semantic label has to be reopened later; treating them as one job means they get
done once.

## Tokens come first

Nothing in `features/` may contain a raw colour, text style, padding value,
radius, elevation, icon size or duration. Those live in `core/theme/` as tokens
and reach widgets through the theme.

Token names are **semantic**, not physical. `AppColors.danger`, not
`AppColors.red`; `AppSpacing.md`, not `AppSpacing.sixteen`. The reason is that
physical names lie the first time the design changes — a `red` token that has
become orange is worse than no token, because now nobody trusts the names.

Read `references/tokens.md` for the token set and the code shape.

Spacing uses one scale: 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32. A layout that needs 15 is
telling you a constraint is wrong somewhere else; reach for the neighbouring
step rather than adding a value to the scale.

## Theme

Material 3 on. Build `ColorScheme` from a seed and then override deliberately —
seeding alone gives a coherent palette, but the semantic colours (success,
warning, info) are not part of `ColorScheme` and need a theme extension.

Configure component themes centrally: AppBar, NavigationBar, Card, Dialog,
BottomSheet, Input, Button, Chip, Snackbar. Setting these once is what stops
every screen re-specifying them slightly differently.

Light and dark are both first-class. Dark is not "light with inverted colours" —
elevation reads through surface tint rather than shadow, and a colour that
passes contrast on white can fail on a dark surface.

Check every interactive component in disabled, pressed, focused and selected
states. Focused especially: it is invisible to mouse users and essential for
keyboard and switch-access users, and it is the state most often left unstyled.

## Components

**The per-component contract lives in `flutter-theme-design`, not here.** This
skill says *that* a component gets tokens, both themes and every state; that
skill says *which* checklist a specific ThemeData slot and its `Mx*` wrapper
must clear before the component counts as supported — including the admission
rule for Material widgets the system does not support yet, and the banned-raw-
widget list the guard enforces. Load it whenever the work is one component
deep. One fact, one place: this file deliberately does not restate its lists.

Build the base set once, in `shared/widgets/`: app scaffold, app bar, primary
button, secondary button, icon button, text field, search field, card, list
item, empty state, error state, loading state, confirmation dialog, bottom
sheet.

Each needs light, dark, enabled, disabled, loading, and error where it applies.
A button without a loading state means every caller invents its own, and they
will not match.

A new shared component is not done until it has a knob-driven playground in the
Widgetbook catalog (`widgetbook/lib/components/`, registered in
`widgetbook/lib/main.dart`) — the catalog is where every state is inspected
under both themes, text scales and viewports without hunting through screens,
and the CI smoke test fails if the tree stops building. New screens go in too,
mounted with their domain contract faked; `widgetbook/README.md` has the
how-to.

**A component that can be tapped is a surface with a target composed into it, not
a control that happens to look like a surface.** A surface that *is* the control
can hold no other control, so the first caller needing one wraps a region of the
content instead — and every region left over then looks tappable and is not. This
is the shape both kits got wrong independently; the contract and the Flutter ink
paint-order trap behind it are in `references/components.md`.

Two further failure modes to avoid, in tension with each other:

- **The god component.** Twenty optional parameters, half mutually exclusive.
  When a component needs a flag that changes its layout structure, that is a
  second component. Sharing a name is not sharing a purpose.
- **Premature sharing.** Two screens looking similar is not a reason to merge
  them. Wait for the second real caller before abstracting — the second caller
  is what tells you which parts actually vary. This is the checklist's "không
  tạo shared widget chỉ vì hai đoạn UI trông gần giống nhau".

Read `references/components.md` for the API conventions.

## Responsive

Mobile-first, then adapt. Use `LayoutBuilder` and the breakpoint tokens; reach
for `MediaQuery` only when you genuinely need screen-level information such as
`viewInsets` for the keyboard. Scattered `MediaQuery.of(context).size` reads
rebuild on every keyboard animation frame and hardcode assumptions about what
"the screen" means.

The four checks that catch nearly everything:

1. **Small screen** — 320×568 logical. Overflow shows here first.
2. **Large text scale** — 1.5× minimum, 2.0× ideally. Fixed-height containers
   with text inside break here.
3. **Keyboard open** — does the focused field stay visible, does the submit
   button stay reachable.
4. **Landscape** — usually a scroll problem.

Also: nothing important within reach of the bottom navigation or the home
indicator, and no action flush against a screen edge.

### Declare the horizontal layout contract, then prove it by measuring

A **band** is anything the reader sees as a full-width step down the page: a
section heading, a card, a panel, a row of cards. Bands declared to share one
content column start and end on the same two x-coordinates. A screen MAY have
an intentionally nested or asymmetric column, but that is a second declared
alignment group, not an accidental inset. A widget that is narrower *on
purpose* — a chip hugging its text, a button inside a card, a heading sharing
its row with a counter — is not a band and is not held to this.

**The trap is a container that is full-width while its children are not.**
`Wrap` sizes its children to their intrinsic width; `Row` without `Expanded`
does the same. Two cards meant to be halves of a row then sit inboard of the
column with dead space at the right, and the band above them measures
perfectly because *the Wrap* is full-width — only the cards are not. This
shipped in Card Import (M99.19a finding V9) and no gate saw it.

So when a band is a row of cards, give each child an `Expanded` (with
`IntrinsicHeight` if they must be equal height) and pick the one-column
fallback with a measured `LayoutBuilder` threshold, not a device guess.

**Extract the geometry contract before implementation.** For a concept-driven
screen, record the content gutters, alignment groups, relative widths/heights,
grid gaps and important baselines in its wireframe or UI contract. Calling a
concept "hierarchy only" MUST NOT discard these layout relationships; theme
tokens own the exact spacing values, while the concept still owns which edges
and proportions relate.

**The visual audit can enforce a declared row-of-surfaces contract.**
For screens whose wireframe declares one surface column, opt that screen into
`SurfaceColumnRule` and provide the production-surface finder explicitly. The
rule groups those surfaces into rows by vertical overlap and fails when a
row's union stops short of the column the other surfaces establish. It is not
global: another screen may intentionally contain nested or asymmetric card
groups, and the harness must not invent a layout contract merely because it
sees an `MxCard`. Its synthetic unit tests pin what it catches, while the
screen's `getRect` tests remain the primary proof of the declared geometry.

**Assert the rest in a widget test, because nothing else can.** The audit
knows about surfaces, not about headings, text fields or the gap between a
title and its metadata. `flutter analyze` and the guard read source text and
cannot see a laid-out rectangle. A golden compares a screen with yesterday's
copy of itself, so an edge that is wrong but stable passes forever — and the
eye misses a few logical pixels on a scaled-down PNG.
An updated golden is therefore a regression baseline only; compare it with the
concept separately and list approved divergences before accepting it.

```dart
final heading = tester.getRect(find.text(l10n.someSectionHeading));
final card = tester.getRect(find.byType(SomeCard));
expect(card.left, moreOrLessEquals(heading.left, epsilon: 0.5));
expect(card.right, moreOrLessEquals(heading.right, epsilon: 0.5));
```

`test/features/card/presentation/card_import_alignment_test.dart` is the
worked example: one helper, every band of every state, plus the stacked case
at 320dp. Measure the widgets a reader sees — a card, a panel — never the
invisible box that holds them, which is what hid the original defect.

## Localization

Every user-visible string comes from ARB. No exceptions — a "temporary"
hardcoded string is one nobody finds again.

Support plurals and placeholders properly. Do **not** assemble sentences from
fragments: `"You have" + count + "items"` is untranslatable, because word order
and pluralisation differ per language. One key, one complete sentence, with
placeholders.

Dates and numbers go through `intl` with the active locale — never
`toString()` on a `DateTime`, and never manual thousands separators.

Plan for text expansion: German and Vietnamese commonly run 30% longer than
English. Test with the longest locale you ship, not the shortest. Check RTL if
it is in scope.

Provide a fallback locale so a missing translation degrades to readable text
rather than a blank or a key name.

## Accessibility

Not a final pass — it is part of writing a component, which is why it lives
here.

- Icon-only controls get a `Semantics` label or `tooltip`. An `IconButton` with
  no label is an unlabelled button to a screen reader.
- Touch targets at least 48×48 logical, even when the icon is smaller.
- Contrast: 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text and meaningful icons —
  in both themes.
- Never encode information in colour alone. A red border needs an error message
  or an icon beside it; roughly 1 in 12 men cannot distinguish it otherwise.
- Form fields have programmatic labels and error text tied to them, so a screen
  reader announces the field and its error together.
- Respect text scaling. Never clamp `textScaler` to 1.0 to fix an overflow —
  that breaks the layout for the users who need it most. Fix the layout.
- Check `MediaQuery.disableAnimations` for reduced-motion before running a large
  animation.
- Verify with TalkBack or VoiceOver, and with the platform accessibility
  scanner. Semantics bugs are close to invisible when reading code.

Read `references/a11y-and-l10n.md` for the concrete patterns and test setup.
