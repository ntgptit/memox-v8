description: Stands up the Flutter project skeleton and everything that is decided once and constrains the rest of the build — toolchain check, git repo conventions, `flutter create` with the right org and IDs, the dependency set and why each package is there, dev dependencies and code generation, build flavors for dev/staging/prod, the bootstrap function with error boundaries, and the Failure/error model. Use this skill when creating a new Flutter app, adding or auditing dependencies, wiring `main.dart` and bootstrap, setting up environments or flavors, configuring build_runner, or designing how errors are represented across layers. Covers checklist phases 2, 3 and 6.

# Project setup and foundation

Covers checklist Phases 2 (environment), 3 (dependencies) and 6 (bootstrap,
flavors, error model). These are grouped because they are decided once and
constrain everything after — the flavor decides the log level bootstrap
installs, and the error model decides what the error boundary reports.

Prerequisite: `docs/product.md` exists and answers platforms, online/offline and
auth. Those three answers change the dependency set, so setting up before they
are settled means redoing it.

## 2.1 Toolchain

```bash
flutter --version && flutter doctor -v
```

Use Flutter stable. Record the exact version in `docs/architecture.md` and pin
it in CI — "works on my machine" is nearly always a toolchain drift.

If `flutter` is not on PATH in this environment, say so plainly and continue
with the work that does not need it (docs, decisions, file layout). Do not
fabricate command output.

## 2.2 Repository conventions

- `.gitignore` — start from the Flutter template, then confirm it excludes
  generated code you do not intend to commit (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`),
  `.env` files, signing keys, and `**/google-services.json` if it holds secrets.
- **Generated code: commit or not?** Pick one and write it down. Committing them
  makes checkout-and-run work and makes diffs noisy; not committing them means
  CI must run `build_runner` before analyze. Not committing is the better default
  here because CI already runs codegen as a freshness check (Phase 19.1).
- Conventional Commits, scoped by feature: `feat(deck):`, `fix(card):`.
- Branch naming: `feat/<slice>`, `fix/<issue>`, `chore/<thing>`.
- PR and issue templates in `.github/`.
- Branch protection on the default branch; no direct pushes.

## 2.3 Creating the project

```bash
flutter create \
  --org <reverse.domain> \
  --project-name <package_name> \
  --platforms=android,ios \
  .
```

Get `--org` right the first time — changing the application ID after a store
release means a new listing, not an update.

Then: delete the counter demo, reduce `main.dart` to a bootstrap call, set the
minimum SDK deliberately (each bump you defer costs you plugin compatibility
later), and confirm a clean build before writing any feature code.

`main.dart` after this step should be a handful of lines: choose the
environment config, call `bootstrap`. Nothing else.

## 3. Dependencies

Read `references/dependencies.md` for the full list with the reason each package
is present and the traps in each one.

The rule that matters more than the list: **do not add a package without a
stated reason, and never two packages for one job.** Every dependency is a
permanent liability — it can break on a Flutter upgrade, be abandoned, or carry
a licence problem. Before adding one, check its last publish date, its open
issue count against a Flutter-stable release, and its licence.

Add with `flutter pub add` so constraints are written correctly, then commit
`pubspec.lock`.

## 6.1 Bootstrap

`bootstrap()` owns startup, `main()` owns nothing but calling it. The reason to
separate them is testability and flavors — three `main_*.dart` entrypoints can
share one bootstrap, and a test can call bootstrap with fakes.

Order matters, because later steps report failures through earlier ones:

1. `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`
2. Logging — first, so everything after it can report.
3. Environment config — decides log level and base URL.
4. Storage and database — these can fail; a database that fails to open is a
   startup failure the user must see, not a silent crash loop.
5. Error boundaries.
6. `runApp` inside a `ProviderScope`, with any overrides for pre-resolved
   async dependencies.

Error boundaries need all three of these; each catches what the others miss:

- `FlutterError.onError` — framework errors, including build errors.
- `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError` — uncaught async errors.
- `ErrorWidget.builder` — replace the red screen in release with something that
  does not leak a stack trace to the user.

Anything that can throw during startup belongs inside a guarded zone that shows
a real error screen. A white screen with no explanation is the worst failure
mode available, because it is indistinguishable from a hang.

## 6.2 Environments and flavors

Three flavors: development, staging, production. Each carries app name,
application ID suffix, API base URL, log level, feature flags and analytics
config.

Model the config as an immutable class chosen at the entrypoint — not read from
a global mutable singleton, and never branched on with `kDebugMode` scattered
through feature code:

```dart
final class EnvConfig {
  const EnvConfig({
    required this.name,
    required this.apiBaseUrl,
    required this.logLevel,
    required this.isAnalyticsEnabled,
  });
  // ...
}
```

Expose it through a Riverpod provider overridden in `bootstrap`, so any layer
reads it the same way and tests can substitute one.

Secrets never live in the repo. `--dart-define-from-file` with an ignored file
locally, CI secrets in the pipeline. Development never points at production
credentials — the day someone runs a destructive test against prod data is the
day you wish this had been enforced.

Distinct application IDs per flavor (`com.x.app.dev`) so all three install side
by side on one device. Read `references/flavors.md` for the Android and iOS
wiring.

## 6.3 Error model

This is the contract between layers, so get it right before any feature uses it.

**Data layer throws typed exceptions.** `DioException`, `DriftWrappedException`
and friends are caught at the *repository boundary* and never travel further.

**Domain layer speaks `Failure`.** A sealed class, so `switch` over it is
exhaustive and the compiler tells you when a new failure type needs handling:

```dart
sealed class Failure {
  const Failure({required this.message, this.cause});
  final String message;   // safe to show a user
  final Object? cause;    // for logs only, never rendered
}

final class NetworkFailure extends Failure { ... }
final class UnauthorizedFailure extends Failure { ... }
final class ForbiddenFailure extends Failure { ... }
final class ValidationFailure extends Failure {
  const ValidationFailure({required super.message, this.problems = const <Enum>{}});
  final Set<Enum> problems;  // typed field problems; drives inline form errors
}
final class NotFoundFailure extends Failure { ... }
final class ConflictFailure extends Failure { ... }
final class DatabaseFailure extends Failure { ... }
final class UnknownFailure extends Failure { ... }
```

`ValidationFailure` carries a **set of typed problems** because that is what the
UI needs to show an error under the right input. Flattened to one string, the UI has
to guess which field is wrong.

Two details memox learned the hard way, both worth copying:

* a `Set`, not a single value, because a form can fail in two places at once — a
  blank name *and* an unchosen option — and one reason means the user is sent round
  twice;
* `Enum` values, not `Map<String, String>`. The map's key was a repeated string
  literal nothing checked, and its value was a message the UI is forbidden to
  render — so presentation ignored the value and re-derived the problem from the raw
  input, which quietly gave the validation rule a second owner. `Enum` rather than a
  feature type because `core/` may not import a feature, and on the *base* class
  because `Failure` is `sealed`, so a feature cannot add a subtype.

**Result type or exceptions?** Either works. Pick one and hold to it —
`Result<T>` makes failure explicit in the signature at the cost of ceremony;
throwing `Failure` and catching in the controller is lighter but easier to
forget. Whichever you choose, the invariant is that a `DioException` never
reaches presentation.

**Messages are for users.** No URLs, SQL, stack traces or internal identifiers.
The technical detail goes in `cause` and into logs. When mapping an unexpected
error, log the original and show something generic — a leaked stack trace in a
snackbar is both a bad experience and an information disclosure.

Put the mapping in one place (`core/error/`) so every repository maps the same
exception to the same failure, and test it (Phase 15.1) — error mapping is the
code most likely to be wrong and least likely to be exercised by hand.
