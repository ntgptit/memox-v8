# CI pipeline and release builds

## GitHub Actions

> **The block below is a reference template, not the live workflow.** The real
> pipeline is a *pair*: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (per PR, one stable `CI gate`
> result) and `.github/workflows/ci-full.yml` (manual milestone/release gate).
> When they disagree with this template, **the workflow files win** — update
> this file when the pipeline changes rather than the other way round.

The live PR workflow builds an immutable verification plan before installing
Flutter:

- The planner classifies each path by feature, architecture layer, public
  contract impact and risk. Scope grows monotonically through the declared
  downstream feature graph; no rule can remove checks selected earlier.
- Prompt and documentation changes stay on the Python contract path. Missing
  review files, malformed seven-field headers and incomplete prompt phases fail
  there without installing Flutter.
- A feature `data` change starts with its data tests, a `presentation` change
  with its presentation tests plus Widgetbook, and a domain contract expands
  through downstream features. A reverse Dart-import closure then adds every
  runnable transitive test consumer, including app, integration and
  cross-feature harness tests that do not live under the owning layer.
- Drift query changes additionally select database and integration contract
  suites declaratively. Generated DAO code is ignored, so those edges cannot be
  recovered from the source-level Dart import graph.
- Golden-only files are never sent to a Linux shard that excludes the `golden`
  tag; their changes select non-golden presentation surrogates plus Widgetbook,
  while `ci-full.yml` remains the Windows pixel-comparison owner. Existing
  untracked tests are part of the local changed-plan discovery universe.
- The resulting runnable file list is balanced across one, two or five atomic
  file-level shards according to measured test declarations.
- Schema/migration, shared UI/theme, app router/DI, native/dependency, CI
  tooling, empty and unknown change sets fail safe to all non-golden host tests
  across five shards. This is also how the planner validates changes to itself.
- Static verification remains global for every code path. Each selected host
  shard generates ignored code locally and uses `--reporter failures-only` to
  avoid printing thousands of successful test events.
- The final `CI gate` job inspects every selected job result. It is the stable
  check a repository ruleset should require; conditional jobs are implementation
  details and may legitimately show as skipped.
- The workflow does not run again on `push` to `main`. A pull request already
  verified its exact head, so the former post-merge duplicate spent another
  full runner window without increasing coverage.

`ci-full.yml` remains deliberately serial/from-cold where that is the evidence
being sought: codegen reproducibility, the complete monolithic suite + count
floor, Windows goldens and the web build. It proves global coverage independently
of the PR planner and is required at milestones/releases; it is not a substitute
for the per-PR aggregate gate.

  # Web is not a release target for memox, but it IS the E2E channel

  # Not enabled for memox yet — iOS is deferred until Android is stable

```

Notes on choices that are easy to get wrong:

- **Pin the Flutter version.** `channel: stable` alone means the pipeline
  silently changes under you, and a stable release eventually breaks something.
- **Uploading golden failure diffs on failure** is what makes a golden failure
  diagnosable in CI. Without it you get "goldens differ" and no image.
- **Cache `~/.pub-cache`** via the action's `cache: true`; it is most of the
  pipeline's wall time.
- **iOS on `macos-latest`** costs several times more runner minutes. Running it
  only on the main branch is a reasonable trade if minutes are limited.

## Release builds

```bash
# Android App Bundle for the store
flutter build appbundle \
  --release \
  --flavor production \
  -t lib/main_production.dart \
  --dart-define-from-file=env/prod.json \
  --obfuscate --split-debug-info=build/symbols/android

# iOS archive
flutter build ipa \
  --release \
  --flavor production \
  -t lib/main_production.dart \
  --dart-define-from-file=env/prod.json \
  --obfuscate --split-debug-info=build/symbols/ios
```

**Keep `build/symbols/`.** Obfuscated crash reports are unreadable without the
matching symbol files, and they must match that exact build — archive them
alongside the artifact, per version.

## Signing

Android: keystore from CI secrets, decoded at build time into a path referenced
by `key.properties`. Never commit the keystore or `key.properties`.

```yaml
- name: Decode keystore
  run: echo "${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64 }}" | base64 -d > android/app/upload-keystore.jks
```

iOS: certificate and provisioning profile from secrets into a temporary keychain
— `apple-actions/import-codesign-certs` handles the fiddly parts.

Losing the Android upload key means you cannot update the listing without Play's
key-reset process. Back it up somewhere durable and outside the repo.

## Versioning

`version: 1.4.2+87` in `pubspec.yaml` — name plus build number. The build number
must increase on every store upload; both stores reject a repeat. Deriving it
from the CI run number removes the manual step and the duplicate-rejection
round-trip.

## Deployment

`fastlane`, or the store CLIs, from a tag-triggered workflow. Always to internal
testing first, then staged rollout: 10% → 50% → 100%, watching crash-free
percentage between steps. A staged rollout is the rollback plan — a bad release
caught at 10% affects a tenth of the users.
